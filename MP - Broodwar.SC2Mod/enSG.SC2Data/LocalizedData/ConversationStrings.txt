Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00013=There's something moving out here! We need detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00014=Think I'll get back to running this show.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00015=Alright, I'm taking back control.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00016=Can't hurt to take a look.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00017=We've scoped out this area. Scout's heading back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00018=Once I've trained up some soldiers we'll head out.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00019=Can't reach that location, partner.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00020=Little busy here. I'll send something out in a minute.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00021=Dammit, they killed my SCV. I'm sending out another.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00022=Detection on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00023=Taking this raven back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00024=Building a raven now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00025=The raven's down. I'll send another!

Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00044=We must retreat!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00052=Our scout is unable to reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00053=Our scout has been destroyed! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00061=Our enemy is Protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00062=We have encountered enemy terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00063=Hostile zerg have shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.

Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00118=Not happenin'.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00161=Let them come.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00180=We require additional warriors.

Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00185=We will require additional troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00186=I am resuming control.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00187=We have lost the enemy. Detection is required.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00188=We require reinforcement.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00189=Quickly, send aid! The battle can still be won!
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00190=The khala will guide my hand.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00191=We are exploring this area.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00192=We have sent forth a scout.
Conversation/AICommunication/BWLine00194=Scouting mission completed.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWGroup00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00024=It was Tassadar who kept the templar from extinction that day.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00079=The war seemed to end there.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00086=Raynor revived his campaign against the Dominion...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00087=...and said the key to stopping Amon... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00088=...armies from the Dominion and Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00089=...with help from Arcturus' son, Valerian...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00091=The Dominion wanted her dead. Raynor couldn't allow it.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00092=...and began planning their next move.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00093=...but his father could not let this opportunity pass.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00094=Kerrigan escaped, while Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00095=She set out to reclaim her position... as Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00096=...and ruled the Swarm once again... only this time... free.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00097=...one mission at a time.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00098=She learned that Raynor was still alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00099=Despite encountering his best troops,  and traps, she personally ended his life.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00100=Amon's plans were still unfolding.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00101=Kerrigan left Raynor to rebuild while she hunted her true enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00102=...with a just government.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/BWLine00103=Hierarch Artanis saw an opportunity.

Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00001=In StarCraft II you view the battle from above as the commander of an army. You use your mouse to control your view of the battlefield and give instructions to the units under your command.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00002=In the lower left of your screen is a minimap that allows you to see what is happening all over the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00003=In the lower right of your screen you can find the command card. The command card is used to issue orders to selected units.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00004=The lower middle of your screen is the unit information panel. This shows information about the units or structures you have selected.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00005=Above the command card is the "Tip" button. The "Tip" button appears when there is new information for your perusal. Simply click the "Tip" button to read the tip.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00006=To change your view, move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen. When your mouse touches the edge of the screen, your view will slide in that direction.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00007=You can also use the minimap to shift your view to any part of the battlefield. Simply left-click on the minimap to jump to a new location.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00008=Now that you have a unit selected, right-click on the ground to order the unit to move somewhere.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00009=To move a unit you must first select it. Use your mouse and left-click on the unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00010=Well done commander.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00011=To attack an enemy, select your units and right-click on the enemy.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00012=During the attack, you can mouse over the enemy to see a bar representing their life. A unit is destroyed when its hit-points reach zero. You can also mouse over your own units to keep an eye on their life bars.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00013=You can also use the attack move command to tell your units to move to a location and attack any enemy forces they encounter along the way.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00014=To make an attack-move command, left-click on the attack button from the command card while your units are selected, and then left-click on the ground where you want your units to go.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00015=To create a new terran structure, first select an SCV by left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00016=Now left-click the "Build Structure" button in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00017=Left-click on the structure you want to build and then left-click anywhere on the ground to order the SCV to place the new structure. The SCV will move to your chosen location, and build the structure there.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00018=The Command Center cannot be constructed too close to minerals. When placing the Command Center look for the overlay to be completely green before left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00019=SCVs are your primary means of collecting resources. While your SCV is selected, right-click a mineral field to begin collecting resources.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00020=Your SCV will start harvesting minerals and dropping them off at the closest Command Center.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00021=You can train more SCVs from the Command Center to gather minerals faster.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00022=Your SCV will continue harvesting until you order it to do something else.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00023=Well done commander. Harvesting minerals is central to any terran strategy.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00024=To create new units, you must first select a structure that trains units. Select a Barracks to see what units you can train from it. Those units will appear in the command card in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/BWLine00025=Left-click on the "Marine" button in the command card to order the Barracks to begin training that unit. Once the unit is complete, it will appear next to the Barracks.

Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00032=Life as an artificial intelligence is really not so bad. You might even say... it's ballin'.
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00033=<HAL impression> I am completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly... Just ask the kalathi.
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00034=Ow! Why was I programmed to feel pain?
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00035=The true end has come.
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00036=So this is to be my fate.
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00037=<Death exertion>
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00040=Conciousness awakened.

Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00042=I was designed to be a pacifist. But I will admit... When I get charged up, I've been known to explode.
Conversation/RobotPusher/BWLine00043=Is this how the Templar treat all robotic life-forms? You would to well to remember, we will outlive you, and we do not forget.

VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed01=Aiur will be reclaimed, at any cost.
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed02=Some Templar identify as a shield, stalwart and unbreakable, defenders of truth.
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed03=Others see themselves as a weapon, powerful and precise.
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed04=I say, why not be both?
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed05=With the right training anyone can be in two places at once, but their mind must be fully open. Oh, and they need a psionic amplifier. That helps too.
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed06=Chasing after your own shade is a pointless endeavor. I mean it moves so quickly!
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed07=Why yes, you could say I have some skill. <laughs>
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed08=What? Just because I'm called an adept doesn't mean I need to brag about it.
VoiceOver/Adept/BWPissed09=I'm here. <SFX: Psionic transfer sound> I'm there. I'm... <SFX: error noise> still here... at least for a few more seconds.

VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed00=It's a cyclone... not a cyclops, alright? <beat> I don't care that it has one eye!
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed01=Oh, this'll drive circles around a diamondback. I guarantee it.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed02=Uh... I'm kinda out of jokes, man. I'm not really a jokey kinda guy.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed03=Gonna just keep poking me anyway, huh? Look, can we get back to fighting? I'm actually good at that!
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed04=How about I make this real simple. You point them out, then I risk my neck by driving right up to them... then, get this, I kill them. Sound good?
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed05=Okay, so this is you: "Hey, Cyclone. What you doing?" Then I'm like, "Nothing, I just want to go kill things!"
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed06="Well how 'bout we have a nice long talk instead?" "Gee, I dunno, boss. That sounds pretty awful. Maybe we could just stop this whole thing and get back to shooting stuff."
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed07="No, I'm just going to keep on doing it. Blah bla-blah bla-blah. Poke poke poke!"
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed08=<sigh> (to self) Don't let 'em get to you, man... just pushing your buttons.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWPissed09=Will you quit doing that!?!
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWReady00=Systems go. Cyclone ready for action.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWReady01=Optics online. Let's go kill something.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWReady_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWWhat00=You got coordinates, or what?
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWWhat01=Comm's open.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/BWWhat02=This ought to be good.

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed01=We come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return freedom to the people.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed02=<SFX: Missile firing> Here's some freedom for ya!. <SFX: 2x Missile firing> And here's some freedom for you! <SFX: Missile firing> Oh, and momma's got a WHOLE LOT of freedom for YOU!<SFX: Many missiles firing>
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed03=If there's a piece of ground you want secure, my Liberator can handle it. Anywhere around it? You're kind of on you own.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed04=We've learned a lot about transforming vehicles since the Viking. Hell, I've only had one crewman snap his spine this week.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed05=Don't tell anyone, but I once piloted a Conservator. Yeah... But it was in college... so ya know... it doesn't count.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed06=I'm a strong believer in personal liberty. That every person has the liberty to do precisely as they are told, or be to put to death. <Maniacal laughter>
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed07=Wow, Liberator to dictator in 5 seconds. That's gotta be some kind of record!
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/BWPissed08=By the way, freedom is NOT free, okay? Freedom costs a buck o' five! Everyone knows that!

Character/Description/BWZealotAlarak=Supplicants are the lowest ranking Tal'darim. They live to serve and die for those above them on the Chain of Ascension, at least until they gain enough power and influence to challenge them to Rak'Shir.

VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed00=My patience runs short, Templar. Do not press me further.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed01=Are you incapable of listening? Or just comprehending?
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed02=So this is the zerg... the "great enemy" who brought the Templar so low? How utterly disappointing.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed03=Bow before your Highlord and submit completely to my rule. Really!?!
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed04=Oh, Hierarch. Is this how you spend your free time? No wonder these "missions" of yours take so very very long...
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed05=There are fates worse than death, you know. I could have you extract terrazine until you lose your mind like that fool Nyon.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed06=(huffs terrazine) The breath of creation fuels my every... what was I... what was I saying? I'm hungry.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWPissed07=Hmm. Maybe I've got it all wrong. Maybe I should show a little compassion. Maybe Amon is just misunderstood... Maybe, maybe we both are.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWReady00=The hour of my vengeance has come!
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWWhat00=Speak. Now.
VoiceOver/Alarak/BWWhat01=You address the Highlord.

VoiceOver/Annihilator/BWPissed05=Enough! <struggles a bit> Someone tell me how to get out of this thing!

VoiceOver/Arbiter/BWPissed01=We judicators are eternally grateful that our Hierarch has allowed us to serve Aiur once more.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/BWPissed02=And yet, you Templar are still wary of our actions. Our desire to fight for our homeworld is equal to any other.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/BWPissed03=You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/BWPissed04=To understand time you must first conceive it. Think of a flat circle. Now, imagine twenty five million circles intersecting that circle at different points from the center.

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/BWPissed05=Adun, Tassadar, Zeratul... All of my mentors met an early end. Perhaps the cost of greatness is too high?
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/BWPissed06=Have you ever said my name backwards? There is a strange music to it...

VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWHelp00=You dare to challenge me?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed00=We are bound by the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed01=But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed02=My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed03=You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed04=Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed05=If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed06=What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed07=And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWPissed08=Ow. I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWReady00=Vengeance for the betrayed.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWWhat00=Ask. I may listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWWhat01=Action is the only course.

VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWWhat03=The talons of Slayn listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWWhat04=Remember your place.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/BWWhat05=Alakor nir shazak.

VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed01=Our fate lies with our homeland. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed02=Many of our people have fallen... but their deaths will not be in vain.
VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed03=The enemy has changed, and so must we.
VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed04=I imagine that Adun never thought he'd see someone like me.
VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed05=What do you call an Aiur protoss who can meld with the shadows? Hm... Overpowered!
VoiceOver/Avenger/BWPissed06=I am but ONE avenger. Please do not refer to us in the plural form.

VoiceOver/Corsair/BWAttack03=By the grace of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWAttack04=Zhakul guilda!
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWAttack05=They shall be disrupted...
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWAttack06=I fight to the end.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWHelp00=The battle begins!
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed00=These skies are mine.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed01=Look at all the pretty lights!
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed02=I wonder what this button does.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed03=I think this was a big mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed04=You might even say... a huge mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed05=If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed06=I must stop staring at the sun.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed07=Corners like it's on rails.
VoiceOver/Corsair/BWPissed08=I feel the need... the need for... an ejector seat! Look out!

VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWAttack03=Darkness overpowering!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWAttack04=Feeble minds...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWAttack05=Unending torment.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWAttack06=Smolder...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWHelp00=Conflict arises.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed00=Aldaris... Betrayer, betrayed.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed01=We live... In times of great need...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed02=Once you go Dark Archon... you never come back...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed03=Do not tempt us... Your mind is not as strong as you think.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed04=Ulreazj lives on... We feel his rage.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed05=The Void... filled with hatred... it mirrors our own.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWPissed06=Our existence... is suffering... do not prolong it.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWReady00=We are as one...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWWhat00=Must have energy...

VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWYes02=We move...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWYes03=<ghostly moan>
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWYes04=As you say...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWYes05=Energy... Need energy!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/BWYes06=The Void burns...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWHelp00=Battle is upon us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed00=By the shadows...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed02=The shadows writhe around me. 
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed03=I stalk the night.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed04=Raszagal, watch over us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed05=I hear an ancient voice whispering from the Void... and it chills my lightless heart.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed_Alt00=By the shadows of Shakuras.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed_Alt01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/BWPissed_Alt02=The shadows writhe around me.

VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWAttack07=The will of the Tal'darim!
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWHelp00=Only destruction awaits our foes.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed00=Creation is meaningless, even a mindless organism can create.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed01=Destruction, however... one's will imposed upon the universe, that is true expression.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed02=The flames of Alarak's wrath will purge this universe of Amon's worshippers. And I shall be the instrument of their destruction.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed03=I feel like destroying something beautiful. To be fair, I always feel this way.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed04=This vessel has as much in common with a void ray as a spear does with a twig.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed05=Show me your foes. And I shall destroy them! Burn them to ash! And then, I'll destroy the ash. Muahaha.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed06=The Nerazim have constructed an Annihilator? Perhaps we have more in common than we think.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWPissed07=I yearn to fly through the darkened skies of Slayn. And then DESTROY them.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWReady00=The Death Fleet descends.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWReady_Alt00=Let destruction commence.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/BWWhat00=I am the ember of eternity.

VoiceOver/Fenix/BWDeath00=Unto death, I serve.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWHelp00=Come brothers, join me in glorious battle!
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed00=On this battlefield I seek only glorious combat. We need not speak, Hierarch, our blades shall speak for us.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed01=What is it you seek, my friend?
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed02=It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed03=As he tore through his enemies, Fenix would repeat to himself a code he lived by. That reminded him why he fought.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed04=I fear no enemy. For the khala is my strength.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed05=I fear not death. For strength is eternal.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWPissed06=May his deeds be remembered forever, and his death never forgotten.

VoiceOver/Fenix/BWYes05=None shall impede me.
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWYes06=Honor guide me!
VoiceOver/Fenix/BWYes07=Without hesitation.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack00=Suffer as we have.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack01=Our power is from within.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack02=Duty is my shield!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack03=Rahlga s'ak-ash! (Translation: Duty is my shield!)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack04=For Aiur!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack05=We will overcome.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWAttack06=Together, we vanquish.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWHelp00=Our foe strikes!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed00=With the Khala fallen to corruption, the memories of our ancestors are lost to us.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed01=For the first time, the halls of the Templar Archives are silent.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed02=It has been difficult to bear.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed03=Without the Khala to rely on our power has proven difficult to control, but not impossible. 
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed04=Your thoughts are growing harder to read... It seems my strength has not fully returned.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed05=Let me try something... You are feeling... happy. No, sad. No, wait, happy. <frustrated exertion> How do the dark templar deal with this?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed06=(sigh) I do not even know how I feel any more...
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed07=I am sorry, our situation is difficult... I lack even the will to make lightning puns... Shocking, I know. Oh, I did it!
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed09=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWPissed_Alt09=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWReady00=Khassar de templari! (Translation: From order comes justice!)

VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWWhat04=The darkness will be repelled.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWWhat05=Wisdom through adversity.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWWhat06=We are focused once more.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWWhat07=Our spirit is indomitable.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWYes00=En taro Tassadar! (Translation: In honor of Tassadar!)
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWYes01=I heed the call.

VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWYes05=Unity through purpose.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWYes06=We continue on.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/BWYes07=For Artanis.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed00=My memory is not what it was....
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed01=These steel limbs are not my own.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed02=I have known only an eternity of war.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed03=My resolve is unending.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed04=There can be only one.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed05=Back in my day I had to teleport to and from school in the snow. Uphill both dimensions.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed06=Youth is wasted on the young.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed07=Where is my walker...? Oh, I'm in it.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWPissed08=The second thing to go is your memory. I can't remember what the first thing is.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes00=It is destined.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes01=Ik s'abeel. (Translation: It is destined.)
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes02=There shall be a reckoning.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes03=Por zalah!
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes04=Our cannons shall sing.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/BWYes05=We march to victory!

VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack00=Strike now!
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack01=The opportune moment has come.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack02=Together, we cannot be matched.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack03=We cannot fail now.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack04=Witness the power of a phase-smith!
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack05=Templari paru! (Translation: Justice awaits!)
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack06=E-sa ahtu! (Translation: Foes beware!)
VoiceOver/Karax/BWAttack07=Foes beware!
VoiceOver/Karax/BWDeath00=I die... a Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWHelp00=I am engaging our foe.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed00=The task ahead of us is difficult, but worthwhile.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed01=I see the grand design behind it all. The intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed02=These psionic storms are growing worse. Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed03=It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed04=I hope my drones are doing alright up there...
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed05=It has only been a short while since we returned to Aiur and had to flee from it. Yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed06=The Khalai long served the firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams and now we are all equal.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWPissed07=I am a phase-smith and I am a Templar... Fenix was right, it is indeed a glorious day.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWReady00=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat00=Yes, Hierarch? 
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat01=My expertise is yours.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat02=What may I resolve? 
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat03=I will find the solution.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat04=I hear you.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat05=We are all Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat06=Amon shall not prevail.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat07=Na ku a'fal Aiur. (Translation: We shall avenge Aiur!)
VoiceOver/Karax/BWWhat08=A phase-smith is always prepared.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes00=It will be.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes01=I concur.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes02=We are united.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes03=The psi-matrix will fall.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes04=Progress is made by the bold.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes05=Shan-ala-ari Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes06=Purpose guides us.
VoiceOver/Karax/BWYes07=Aiur will be restored.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack00=My power is vast.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack01=You will not decide our fate!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack02=Be gone.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack03=Your time has ended.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack04=I am unstoppable.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack05=I sense their fear...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWAttack06=All shall be one with the light!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWDeath00=This was not to be...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWHelp00=I strike at the enemy!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed00=So long as Amon lives, we are all in peril.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed01=I will bring peace to the cosmos.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed02=So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed03=I am the culmination of prophecy.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed04=I can see everything now... 
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed05=...the thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed06=Alone, we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWPissed07=That bond must sustain us now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWReady00=I am infinite.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat00=What is it you require?
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat01=Speak to me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat02=My destiny manifests.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat03=Infinity unravels before me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat04=A new age will dawn.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat05=Amon shall meet his end.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWWhat06=I can see... countless universes.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes00=The final stand begins now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes01=I am called.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes02=I cannot delay.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes03=This is my burden to bear.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes04=I will not fail.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/BWYes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack00=You're in my way...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack01=No mercy.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack02=Death awaits you!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack03=I sense your fear.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack04=Slay them all!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack05=This is what you deserve.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWAttack06=Whatever it takes.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWDeath00=This isn't over...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWHelp00=The fight begins.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed00=My true enemy waits in the darkness.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed01=Amon and his hybrid will die.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed02=This is the true war--the one that could end everything.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed03=I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis. 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed04=Are you trying to annoy me?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed05=Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed06=I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed07=I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWPissed08=So much has happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years... 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWReady00=I will not be stopped.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat00=What is it, already?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat01=Speak.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat02=Yes?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat03=Your queen listens.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat04=You have my attention.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat05=Explain yourself.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWWhat06=Make it quick.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWYes00=I am the Swarm.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWYes01=Boldly.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWYes02=No time like the present.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/BWYes03=My search continues...

VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/BWPissed03=I hear the call of the stars.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/BWPissed04=Night falls. And so will you.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/BWPissed05=I am one with the darkness... (Crashing sound) Ouch! That hurt.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/BWPissed06=You look better in the dark.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/BWPissed07=Don't blink.... Or you''ll miss me.

VoiceOver/Vorazun/BWPissed04=I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/BWPissed05=Not that we wouldn't enjoy watching you try.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/BWPissed06=But... that is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.

VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed03=All supplicants must die. All supplicants must serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed04=Ah, the Breath of Creation. More like the Breath of Recreation, am I right?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed05=There was once a Supplicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest of us. He was a Tall-darim.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed06=Okay, maybe I deserve to die for that one.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed07=A few of the other supplicants and I have a bet going over which of us dies first. We call it... the "dead league." We're still working on the name.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWPissed08=Witness me!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWReady00=My life for the Highlord.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWReady_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat00=I will adhere to the chain.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat01=Awaiting your decree.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat02=Eternal obedience.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat03=My sacrifice will have meaning.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat04=Loyalty unto death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat05=I am a servant of Slayn.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat06=Oblivion beckons.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWWhat_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes00=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes01=I live to serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes02=My fate is in your hands.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes03=For Alarak.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes04=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/BWYes05=Without remorse.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack00=The shadow descends.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack01=Break before us!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack02=Your end has come.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack03=Zerashk gulida!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack04=Face the endless Void!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack05=May our blades strike true.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWAttack06=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWDeath00=Void embrace me.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWDeath01=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWDeath02=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWDeath03=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWDeath04=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWHelp00=Our blades meet the enemy.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed00=I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed01=Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed02=We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed03=Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred Centurions. Never more, never less. Unless one falls in battle, and then we replace them... quickly.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed04=What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed05=Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us merely bend it to our will, from time to time.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed06=We fashion armor from the bones of our prey. It is a grand tradition reminding us of how far we have come... No. We do not have "jaw envy."
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWPissed07=The Templar zealots won't admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWReady00=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat00=The Shadow Guard waits.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat01=Give us your command.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat02=We stand watch.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat03=Na adan sai'osh.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat04=Ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat05=We await our charge.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWWhat06=None shall break us.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes00=So be it.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes01=Your command is law.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes02=For Vorazun!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes03=The guard moves.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes04=We shall shield this world.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/BWYes05=Eternally resolute.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack00=Executing.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack01=As the Hierarch wills.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack02=Know the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack03=We are the overwhelming tide.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack04=Your purification is at hand!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack05=To glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWAttack06=Be undone!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWDeath00=Releasing consciousness.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWHelp00=We meet the enemy in battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed00=I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed01=Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed02=We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed03=It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed04=Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed05=Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed06=When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWPissed07=A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWReady00=This warrior awakens.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat00=Listening.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat01=Guide my blade.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat02=The enemy shall be purified.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat03=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat04=Speak your demands.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat05=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWWhat06=Identify our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes00=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes01=Protocols aligned.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes02=With honor.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes03=My blade yearns to meet our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes04=For Fenix!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/BWYes05=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/ZealotShakuras/BWReady00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWHelp00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat05=We stand unified.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat06=Na adan Daelaam.

VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat_Alt05=We stand as one.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/BWWhat_Alt06=Na adan atum.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWAttack00=There is much to answer for.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWAttack01=The scales will be balanced.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWAttack02=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWAttack03=Oblivion descends!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWAttack04=We must act!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWDeath00=The Void... beckons.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWHelp00=My enemies close in!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWHelp01=I face a new trial.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed00=I stand at the threshold of destiny.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed01=Only the truth can lead us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed02=The xel'naga have given us the keys to our future.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed03=We must be ever watching... ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed04=I suspect vigilance is one of your... weaker attributes.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed05=Kindly leave me to my meditation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed06=How am I to avert disaster with your constant meddling?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWPissed07=I see. This is but another test.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWReady00=I will find hope for our people.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWWhat00=I seek the path of salvation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWWhat01=My burdens weigh heavily.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWWhat02=You address me?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWWhat03=I bring wisdom in times of chaos.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWWhat04=S'shozak mok nul.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes00=I shall find a way.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes01=Glory to the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes02=Honor commands.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes03=En aru'din Raszagal.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes04=We must not hesitate.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes05=The prophecy guides us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes06=My allegiance is yours.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/BWYes07=I will fulfill my calling.
