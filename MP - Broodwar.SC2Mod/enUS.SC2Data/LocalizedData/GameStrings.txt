Missile/BWBlendAtNotGreaterThanStopAt=BlendAt[%1] not > StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phases[%4, %5].  The blend out termination distance of a given phase must be at a further distance than the stop distance of the prior phase.
Missile/BWCannotHaveBlendOnFinalPhase=Cannot have blend on final phase.  Mover[%1].
Missile/BWCannotHaveNegativeOutroRanges=Cannot have negative outro ranges.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/BWCannotHaveZeroStopAtDistanceOnZeroethPhase=Cannot have 0 stopAt distance on zeroeth phase if there is more than 1 phase.  Mover[%1].
Missile/BWCannotPowerslideOnNonPositiveAccel=Cannot use powerslide on phases with non-positive acceleration.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/BWEmptyThrowVector=Empty throw vector.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].
Missile/BWInvalidPitchThrowBand=Invalid pitch throw band.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].

Missile/BWStopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  The distance at which a phase completely stops must be at or past the distance at which the phase starts to blend out.
Missile/BWUnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Unsupported - negative BlendAt[%1] and positive StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4].  Cannot specify the start of a blend out for a phase with respect to the target, while simultaneously specifying the final stop distance of that phase with respect to the launch point.  This would create varying and probably unexpected behaviors as launch and target points varied in distance from one another.
Missile/BWUnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CMoverMissile[%1]; Missiles only support the ground height map.  The air height map enables fliers to move smoothly over cliffs -- it offers no assistance to missiles and would only causes glitches in missiles that need to be near the ground.  It is therefore ignored on missiles.
Missile/BWZeroGravityOnBallisticMover=Zero gravity on ballistic mover.  Mover[%1] Phase[%2].

Although the Protoss are loathe to sacrifice valuable Templar, those that do achieve this final level of commitment are honoured in the annals of the Templar Archives.
Button/Tooltip/BWArchonACGluescreenDummy=Powerful psionic attacker.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWAssimilator=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Warped in over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.</c><n/><n/>The Assimilator is a Protoss building used for harvesting vespene gas. Although materials are usually warped in from Aiur, vespene is still required for these materials to be produced and the creation of warp rifts.
Button/Tooltip/BWAssimilatorRich=Warped in over a Vespene Geyser to allow harvesting of vespene gas.
Button/Tooltip/BWAttack=Orders selected units to move to the target point, fighting nearby enemies along the way. Targeting a unit with the Attack command orders that it be attacked until it is destroyed.

Button/Tooltip/BWAttackWarpPrism=Orders selected units to move to the target point, fighting nearby enemies along the way. Targeting a unit with the Attack command orders that it be attacked until it is destroyed.
Button/Tooltip/BWAutoTurret=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automated defensive turret. Times out after <d ref="Behavior,AutoTurretTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Auto turrets have long been used in defending Confederate installations from mercenaries and fringe colonists looking for a quick payday with great success.  However, they were ill suited to defend against the Sons of Korhal and the Zerg.  When the Dominion took hold of this technology they realized instead of re-deploying this, they could miniturize an auto turret to be manufactured aboard the Magellan.  In mid-flight, the cybernetic construct can rapidly launch an auto-turret projectile at an area where it quickly deploys and provides light resistance, or if anything, a distraction against incoming enemies.

Button/Tooltip/BWBanshee=<c val="ffff8a">Tactical-strike aircraft. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Backlash Rockets</c><n/><n/>The AH/G-24 Banshee Tactical-Strike Aircraft has been contracted out to Procyon Industries to meet requirements from the newly formed Terran Dominion for a dedicated ground attack aircraft for counter-insurgency operations. The Banshee is an entirely new design as adapting an existing design was unlikely to be satisfactory.  By the early months of the Dominion only several prototypes existed and several were actually stolen by mercenaries like Schezar's Scavagers in hit and run raids off Procyon's dry-dock facilities due to low security.<n/><n/>The banshee is powered by relatively low-thrust and inexpensive VTOL turbofans capable of operating only in an atmosphere. The turbofans are sturdy, simple in design, and relatively easy to maintain. They allow for indefinite loitering with minimal noise, which is perfect for stealth operations.  Engineers have contemplated it may be possible to outfit the Banshee with a cloaking system similar to the aging Confederate Wraith's, but for now, this remains in a pre-prototype design.
Button/Tooltip/BWBansheeACGluescreenDummy=Tactical-strike aircraft. Can be upgraded to use cloak.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWBarracks=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Infantry-production facility.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Marines<n/>- Bunkers</c><n/><n/>The Barracks houses and trains all of the Terran infantry units.

Button/Tooltip/BWBattlecruiser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Powerful warship. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon (limited availability)</c><n/><n/>The massive, Behemoth-Class Battlecruisers are virtual flying fortresses, built to keep the peace within the Terran Sector. Outfitted with multiple laser batteries and thick NeoSteel armor, these ships are easily the most powerful of the Colonial vessels. Many Colonial generals use Battlecruisers as their command centers during long space campaigns.
Button/Tooltip/BWBattlecruiserACGluescreenDummy=Powerful warship. Can use Yamato Cannon and Tactical Jump.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWBattlecruiserMengskACGluescreenDummy=Powerful Royal Guard warship. Can use Yamato Cannon and Tactical Jump.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground and air units.</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWBrutaliskACGluescreenDummy=Massive assault beast that dwarfs even the Ultralisk in size and strength. <n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWBuildCreepTumor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">A burrowed creep generator. Creep feeds nearby Zerg structures. A Creep Tumor can spawn additional Creep Tumors.</c><n/><n/>Recent evolutions made possible by Abathur have evolved the liquid globs of tissue creating noxious creep from brood queens into a more cohesive form.  This new form is self-regenerative, allowing creep to be generated from within.  The tumor is able to self-replicate itself to a new location on creep, leaving behind an imperfect copy, yet allowing creep to generate.  This tumor greatly benefits the Swarm's ability to spread creep and has seen the de-evolution of the creep colony because of it.  This increase in creep may allow more evolutions possible for when zerg are present on creep.
Button/Tooltip/BWBuildCreepTumorPropagate=A burrowed creep generator. Creep feeds nearby Zerg structures. A Creep Tumor can spawn additional Creep Tumors.<n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Bonus: Zerg move faster on creep.</c>

Units inside the Bunker gain +1 range.</c><n/><n/>Designed to safeguard troops from enemy fire, Bunkers can be constructed to defend any pivotal location. The bunker typically accommodates, but is not limited to, four individuals. Weapon ports are located on all sides, with ammunition racks above them. Entry and exit is through a single hatch to the rear.
Button/Tooltip/BWBunkerACGluescreenDummy=Defensive structure. Infantry fight from inside with +1 range bonus.
Button/Tooltip/BWBunkerDepotMengskACGluescreenDummy=Defensive structure that provides supply.<n/>Supply allows you to create more units.<n/>Troopers fight from inside. <n/><n/><c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Bonus: +1 range to units inside.</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWCancelCocoonMorph=Cancels the morph order.
Button/Tooltip/BWCancelMutateMorph=Cancels the mutation order, returning the structure to its original state.
Button/Tooltip/BWCancelSlot=Drops a specific selected order from a point in the queue without performing it.
Button/Tooltip/BWCancelUpgradeMorph=Cancels the upgrade order, returning the structure to its original state.
Button/Tooltip/BWCarrier=<c val="ffff8a">Capital ship. Can build and launch Interceptors to make attacks. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Interceptors</c><n/><n/>The massive Carriers serve as command centers for the leaders of the Protoss fleets. Heavily armored and shielded, Carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by unleashing flights of robotic Interceptors at vital enemy targets. Although the Carriers have no weapon batteries or armaments of any kind, their deployment of Interceptor flights makes them devastating in ship to ship battle.

Button/Tooltip/BWCarrierAiurACGluescreenDummy=Capital ship. Builds and launches Interceptors that attack enemy targets. Can be upgraded with Repair Drones that heal nearby mechanical units.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWCarrierFenixACGluescreenDummy=Capital ship. Builds and launches Interceptors that attack enemy targets.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWChangeling=Changelings cannot attack. When a Changeling first encounters an enemy unit, it will match that unit's color and change into a Zealot, Marine, or Zergling, depending on the enemy race. Dies after <d time="150"/>.
Button/Tooltip/BWCharge=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fenix charges towards a unit at high speed.</c><n/><n/>Not one to shy away from battle, Praetor Fenix is usually found at the front lines of combat due to his advanced augmentation to his armor's leg enhancements which provides a momentary boost of speed.  This upgrade is currently being evaluated for deployment to all Zealots in the near future.<n/><n/>Protoss whom have sparred with Fenix before have stated the mighty templar charging toward them at lightning speed was "terrifying".
Button/Tooltip/BWCheer=Orders selected units to cheer. (If they have the animations to do so)
Button/Tooltip/BWCliffWalk=This unit can walk up and down cliffs.
Button/Tooltip/BWCloakOff=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Decloaks the selected unit, making it visible to enemies.</c>

This âinvisibilityâ has earned the Ghosts a fear-inspired reputation for their mysterious battlefield tactics. Older models of the Ghost Hostile Environment Suit may not be equipped with a personal cloaking device, but they may be retrofitted with them in the field.
Button/Tooltip/BWCloakingField=Cloaking Field passively cloaks friendly nearby units and structures.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Passive ability.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWColossus=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful battle strider. Can walk up and down cliffs. Attacks incinerate multiple enemies at once.

Button/Tooltip/BWHatchery=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary structure. Used to spawn all Zerg units and receive gathered resources. Grows creep used to feed nearby Zerg structures. Can mutate into a Lair.</c><n/><n/>The Hatchery is the heart of any Zerg cluster. It acts not only as a resource return point and processing centre, but it produces the Larvae from which all other Zerg are spawned. Larvae are produced at a steady rate and will stay near the Hatchery of their creation. Like all Zerg structures, Hatcheries are living organisms that heal damage over time, making them very difficult to eradicate.<n/><n/>The Hatchery is the only structure that can be built without the benefit of existing Creep since it has been genetically designed to automatically produce enough to fuel its own growth. Creep Colonies, however, are required to extend this bio-matter further.

Button/Tooltip/BWHellion=<c val="ffff8a">Fast scout. Has a flame attack that damages all enemy units in its line of fire.  Can attack ground units.</c></c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Infernal flamethrower</c><n/><n/>In use by 2490, the hellion was originally developed as an armored combat vehicle, but was deemed too cumbersome to be effective in its intended scout role. After it was stripped down to a bare-bones neosteel frame, engineers began reconstructing the hellion as a lightly armored vehicle, focused on speed and mobility. The hellion ended up becoming one of the best terran skirmishers in the Koprulu sector and beyond.<n/><n/>Hellions are capable of causing damage disproportionate to their size, particularly against enemy infantry, thanks to their heavy infernal flamethrowers.  This is directed using an antiquated targeting system.  The low cost, exceptional agility, and devastating firepower of these vehicles have made them extremely popular with mercenary companies.
Button/Tooltip/BWHerculesACGluescreenDummy=Massive transport ship. Can use Tactical Jump.
Button/Tooltip/BWHerd=This unit will often group with and follow other units

Button/Tooltip/BWHive=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Further evolved version of the Hatchery that allows additional upgrades and structures to be produced. Also spawns all Zerg units and receives gathered resources.</c><n/><n/>The most evolved form of the Hatchery is the Hive. Protected by a dense exoskeleton and granted full access to the Overmindâs pool of knowledge, a Hive enables its cluster to produce the most sophisticated breeds and structures to be found within the Swarm.
Button/Tooltip/BWHoldFire=Orders selected units to stay where they are and ignore enemies that are within range. Units will neither chase down enemies nor move to engage.
Button/Tooltip/BWHunterSeekerMissile=Deploys a Seeker Missile which activates after <d time="5"/> and pursues the target unit, dealing <d ref="Effect,SeekerMissileDamage,Amount"/> splash damage upon contact.
Button/Tooltip/BWHydralisk=<c val="ffff8a">High-damage ranged unit. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Needle Spines</c><n/><n/>The peaceful, herbivore herds of Slothien were assimilated into the Zerg Swarm in order to produce one of the most fierce and diabolical of the Zerg strains. The evolutionary matrix of the caterpillar-like Slothien was supercharged by the Overmind, twisting the hapless creatures into the nightmarish killers known as Hydralisks. These once mild creatures now hunger for blood and violence, and they are infamous for acting in a particularly sadistic fashion.<n/><n/>The spindly, snake-like Hydralisks house hundreds of armour piercing spines within their upper carapace plates. These spines can be fired in volleys at enemies approaching from either the ground or the air, and massed groups of Hydralisks should be approached with extreme caution.
Button/Tooltip/BWHydraliskACGluescreenDummy=Ranged attacker.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWHydraliskDen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Contains upgrades for Hydralisks.</c><n/><n/>Enables:<c val="#ColorWhite"><n/>- Hydralisks</c><n/><n/>The Hydralisk Den bears only a passing resemblance to the nests of the once-peaceful Slothien that the Hydralisks were evolved from. The slime-covered walls of this vile place contain within them the knowledge necessary for a Hive cluster to produce Hydralisk warriors.
Button/Tooltip/BWHydraliskLurkerACGluescreenDummy=Ranged attacker. Can morph into a Lurker. <n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWImmortal=<c val="ffff8a">Assault strider. Can use Barrier to absorb damage. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Cybernetic war machines, Immortals stem from dragoons. Historically, crippled veteran Templar could volunteer to continue serving by being transplanted into dragoon exoskeletons. This honored tradition was broken by the fall of Aiur when the shrine dedicated to dragoon creation was infested by the zerg. Following the Brood War, crippled templar were transplanted into the new immortal exoskeletons instead with fallen hero Eredas being the first. Others began to see common service by 2502. The remaining dragoons were transformed into immortals. As a result, immortals house some of the most skilled and venerable warriors of the protoss military.<n/><n/>Immortals are outfitted with two twin phase disruptors as their primary attack form; they give critical fire support to legions of zealots against ground targets, deployed when the protoss are faced with heavy enemy firepower. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents Immortals from engaging aerial targets. When deployed, immortals give critical support by eliminating enemy artillery and ranged attackers.  Immortals are equipped with armor weave that mitigates impacts through energy dissipation.  Additionally, the hardened shields used by immortals are created by intertwining spectrums and wavelengths of varying intensity. Through this, these shields are incredibly dense, able to mitigate powerful impacts such as siege tank rounds or the blades of an ultralisk, through energy dissipation.

Button/Tooltip/BWInfestor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Infestation specialist. Can use the Fungal Growth and Infested Terran abilities.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorLightGrey">Borbu Matriarch</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">None</c><n/><n/>Infestors are carried by sturdy legs that secrete a corrosive substance that softens the soil and allows them to burrow in the blink of an eye. Unlike most zerg strains, infestors have the ability to move while burrowed. Hardened plates of assimilated mold and fungus functions as a weapon, as the infestor can turn the inner layer of its carapace into a viscous fluid that breaks down matter in seconds and immobilizes anything it comes in contact with. Infestors are known to ingest infested marines to use as terror weapons on the battlefield, carrying them to a combat zone. The marines are stored in thick flesh cavities until the infestor regurgitates them to face their former compatriots, or anything else that might pose a threat to the Swarm.<n/><n/>Perhaps the infestor's most dangerous feature is the neural parasite, a symbiotic creature living within infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. This is inserted through a parasitic stinger, a flexible appendage that is capable of boring through both natural and organic plating. The parasite then is then inserted directly into the target's central nervous system. The amorphous, multi-mouthed parasite cannot survive for long within a foreign body, but whatever horrific deeds the host carries out while under the influence of the Swarm will leave everlasting scars.
Button/Tooltip/BWInfestorTerran=An Infested Terran does moderate damage and lasts for <d ref="Behavior,InfestedTerranTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds.<n/><n/><c val="FFFF8A">Can attack ground and air units.</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWLair=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Evolved version of the Hatchery that allows additional upgrades and structures to be produced. Also spawns all Zerg units and receives gathered resources. Can mutate into a Hive.</c><n/><n/>A Hatchery that âmaturesâ, or evolves, into a Lair benefits from both increased toughness and extended access to the stored genetic knowledge of the Overmind. This allows Zerg Drones to metamorph into more complex structures, which in turn provide the genetic code needed by Larvae to metamorph into new breeds.
Button/Tooltip/BWLand=Lands the structure at a target location, allowing it to once again produce units, research upgrades, and use abilities.
Button/Tooltip/BWLarva=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Morphs into Zerg units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>The closest creatures to the original Zerg insectoids are the Zerg Larvae. Although their size and toughness were greatly boosted by the XelâNaga during their experiments, they still possess the two traits that originally intrigued the ancient masters: genetic versatility and psychic sensitivity. <n/><n/>Each larva contains within it the genetic makeup of every other Zerg breed. A young hive will only have the genetic code for the most basic of Zerg breeds, such as the Drone, but as it grows and develops new structures, the larvae can expand their library of genetic strains. With a command from the Overmind, the larvae will enter a pupal state and begin the metamorphosis into whichever breed is required by the hive.

Realizing the Dominion needed a greater combat unit better able to defeat zerg carapaces the 5-4 Armored Infantry Suit was developed from the firebat's CMC-660 and equipped with two Quad K12 "Punisher" grenade launchers on each arm. The suit's grenade auto-loader is stocked with components that allow it to manufacture and load hundreds of standard Punisher grenades.<n/><n/>Still in a prototype stage, these suits have never seen actual combat while the Dominion continues to test the rigors of the grenade launchers against the suits armor to determine the right blast recoil until the combat suit explodes, often with the helpless criminal pilot still inside.

Button/Tooltip/BWMineralField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest resources from this Mineral Field.</c><n/><n/>The planets along the rim are often dotted with clusters of precious Mineral crystals. These Minerals are smelted down and used to create the armored hulls of starships, vehicles and personal armor. Even the Zerg require Minerals to harden their carapaces and develop strong teeth and bones.<n/><n/>The Mineral crystals take some time to gather, and only SCVs, Drones, and Probes have the necessary equipment to break off bits of the crystals and return them to the proper building.
Button/Tooltip/BWMissileTurret=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Anti-air defensive structure. Can attack air units.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Longbolt Missiles</c><n/><n/>Missile Turrets are relatively inexpensive structures that will automatically target and fire upon incoming enemy aircraft. They also serve as sentry stations equipped with powerful sensors capable of detecting cloaked vessels.

By doing this, larvae will be incubated more rapidly.  This ability has been of great interest to the Queen of Blades, as it allows her army to rapidly grow from her numerous larvae spawn points.
Button/Tooltip/BWMorphToOverseer=Advanced aerial observer. Provides the same supply as an Overlord. Can use the Spawn Changeling and Contaminate abilities.<n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWMutaliskBroodlordACGluescreenDummy=Air unit. Bounces its shot to strike multiple targets. Can morph into a Brood Lord.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground and air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWNeuralParasite=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Target unit is controlled by the Infestor for <d ref="Behavior,NeuralParasite,Duration"/> seconds. The Infestor cannot take any other action while controlling an enemy unit.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Channeled ability.</c></c><n/><n/>Perhaps the infestor's most dangerous feature is the neural parasite, a symbiotic creature living within infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. This is inserted through a parasitic stinger, a flexible appendage that is capable of boring through both natural and organic plating. The parasite then is then inserted directly into the target's central nervous system. The amorphous, multi-mouthed parasite cannot survive for long within a foreign body, but whatever horrific deeds the host carries out while under the influence of the Swarm will leave everlasting scars.
Button/Tooltip/BWNexus=<c val="ffff8a">Primary structure. Can receive gathered resources.<n/><n/>Enables:</c><n/><c val="#ColorWhite">- Probes</c><n/><n/>The mammoth, pyramidal visage of the Nexus looms over each and every Protoss settlement. The Nexus serves as a psychic anchor, allowing the Protoss to access their psionic energy matrix from across the galaxy. <n/><n/>The Nexus also manufactures the small robot Probes that gather precious resources and lay down the warp beacons required to teleport in other Protoss buildings.
Button/Tooltip/BWNukeArm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Arms the Silo with a Tactical Nuke. Nukes take 20 seconds to land, but they deal up to 300 (+200 vs. structures) damage in a large radius. Use a Ghost to designate the target.</c><n/><n/>The modern, relatively small tactical nukes are widely used by most advanced Terran militaries. To prevent outside tampering with the missile guidance commands, a Ghost agent is required to actually direct the missile to its target.
Button/Tooltip/BWNukeCalldown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Calls down a Nuclear Strike at a target location. Nukes take 20 seconds to land, but they deal 500+ damage to enemies in a large radius.</c><n/><n/>One of the primary responsibilities of the Ghost is to locate enemy units or structures for tactical nuclear strikes. Using a special frequency targeting laser, the Ghost can direct missiles from any friendly silos with pinpoint accuracy.
Button/Tooltip/BWNydusCanal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Friendly ground units can use a Nydus Canal to instantly travel to any other Canal within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery. The initial canal entrance is created and then, when a suitable site is found, a sister entrance can be opened. The Canal then enables Zerg ground units to travel from one end to the other at extremely high speed regardless of intervening terrain.<n/><n/>This enables multiple Hatcheries located across a large area to function as one unified nest, with Zerg warriors travelling from one combat zone to another quickly and efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/BWNydusCanalLoad=Loads units into the Nydus Network.
Button/Tooltip/BWNydusCanalUnloadAll=Unloads all units.
Button/Tooltip/BWNydusNetwork=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Friendly ground units can use a Nydus Canal to instantly travel to any other Canal within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery.

Button/Tooltip/BWObserver=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Flying spy. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies without detection.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>These small drones are employed to survey vast wasteland areas or observe and record battles for study within the Archives. Their complex sensor array leaves little energy for defenses, but they can detect cloaked or concealed units with ease, making them invaluable on the battlefield.<n/><n/>Observers that are used for deep-space exploration are often deployed without any defensive systems, but when used in a combat zone they are equipped with a micro-cloaking field to hide them from the enemy. Like the Arbiter, the Observer does not require any additional energy to maintain the field.
Button/Tooltip/BWObserverACGluescreenDummy=Flying spy. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies without detection.<n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWObserverFenixACGluescreenDummy=Flying spy. Cloak renders the unit invisible to enemies without detection.<n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWOrbitalCommandUnit=Primary structure. Used to train SCVs and receive gathered resources. Can use the Scanner Sweep and Calldown: Extra Supplies abilities.
Button/Tooltip/BWOverlord=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to create more units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Gargantis Proximae</c><n/><n/>The semi-intelligent, space-faring behemoths known as the Gargantis Proximae were inducted into the Swarm so that their heightened senses could benefit Zerg warriors in battle. The Gargantis flyers were assimilated into the Swarm so well that the Cerebrates use them to maintain control over their forces. Overlords keep the warriors of the swarm ordered and coordinated during battle, and with their enhanced senses they often serve as advanced scouts. They have the innate ability to sense any hidden enemy units, including those under the effects of cloaking systems or distortion fields.<n/><n/>In addition to commanding troops against their enemies, the Overlords also have the responsibility of transporting Zerg warriors within the hollows of their reinforced carapace hides. Only larger Zerg nests seem to have this particular breed of Overlord, but it is generally a good idea to kill these creatures on sight for safetyâs sake.
Button/Tooltip/BWOverlordCocoon=This cocoon contains an Overlord as it is morphing into an Overseer.
Button/Tooltip/BWOverlordTransportLoad=Loads units into the Overlord's ventral sacs.

Button/Tooltip/BWPermanentlyCloakedObserver=The Observer is permanently cloaked.
Button/Tooltip/BWPhaseShift=Causes the targeted unit to phase out for <d ref="Behavior,Ethereal,Duration"/> seconds. Phased units are immune to all damage and most effects, but they are unable to attack or use abilities.
Button/Tooltip/BWPhasingMode=Transforms the Warp Prism to Phasing Mode and generates a power radius similar to that of a Pylon. The Warp Prism cannot move in this mode.

Button/Tooltip/BWPhotonCannon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Primary defensive structure. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>The Protoss revel in the glory of personal combat, but they also recognise the need for automated defenses to watch over their colonies. Photon Cannons are enhanced with special sensor technology borrowed from the tiny Observer, enabling them to detect cloaked and hidden units.<n/><n/>As with all Protoss buildings, care should be taken to provide ample Pylon support for Cannons. Should their link to the Psionic Matrix be broken, they will shut down â thus leaving the way open to the enemies of Aiur.

Button/Tooltip/BWPointDefenseDrone=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Automated defensive turret. Times out after <d ref="Behavior,AutoTurretTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Auto turrets have long been used in defending Confederate installations from mercenaries and fringe colonists looking for a quick payday with great success.  However, they were ill suited to defend against the Sons of Korhal and the Zerg.  When the Dominion took hold of this technology they realized instead of re-deploying this, they could miniturize an auto turret to be manufactured aboard the Magellan.  In mid-flight, the cybernetic construct can rapidly launch an auto-turret projectile at an area where it quickly deploys and provides light resistance, or if anything, a distraction against incoming enemies.
Button/Tooltip/BWPrimalGuardianACGluescreenDummy=Long range anti-ground flier.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack ground units.</c>

Button/Tooltip/BWProbe=<c val="ffff8a">Basic worker unit. Can gather resources and warp in Protoss structures. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Particle Beam</c><n/><n/>Probes are robotic drones that service the Nexus and gather the numerous resources needed to power Protoss technologies. Probes also manufacture and plant the micro-beacons that anchor the teleport matrices of Protoss structures. These beacons allow the Protoss to warp in prefabricated buildings from their Homeworld.
Button/Tooltip/BWProbeHallucination=These hallucinated copies function like the original unit, but they cannot use active abilities, deal damage, warp in structures, or gather resources, and they die more easily. Hallucinations last <d time="60"/> before they disappear.

Button/Tooltip/BWPsiStorm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a storm of psionic energy that lasts 4 seconds, causing up to 112 damage to all units in the target area.</c><n/><n/>One of the first lessons of the Khala is how to close oneâs mind to the outside world. The Protoss are such powerful psychics that they can inadvertently send out psychic âripplesâ that are disruptive to other life forms. With careful training, High Templar learn to focus these ripples into a storm of raw psychic energy that is capable of literally tearing apart the minds of lesser species.
Button/Tooltip/BWPylon=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides supply. Supply allows you to warp in more units. Creates power for nearby structures.</c><n/><n/>Carved from the sacred Khaydarin Crystals found only on the Protoss Homeworld, Pylons act as focal points for the Psionic Matrix emitted by the Nexus.

A breakthrough came when rapid xel'naga energy was introduced, causing a brief, but useful catalyst for evolution.  The result is a Ravager which has evolved the Roach far beyond its biological limitations.  Ravagers stand almost four times as tall as a terran wearing CMC armor, and hardened bone spikes portrude from its back. Its eyes grant it a broad spectrum of vision.<n/><n/>The ravager wields plasma fire both in close-quarters combat and as a wedge to crack open entrenched positions, something the Swarm has struggled with in the past.  As an evolution of the roach, the ravager has developed a larger, heavier frame to store quantities of fiery fluid in its back. The ravager can launch a gob of corrosive bile from its back in a parabolic arc. This projectile is slow, best used against stationary targets, but can destroy protoss force fields, and is effective against heavy units and structures.  While this evolution to the Roach will not be sustainable in newer generations, Abathur has already begun work on how to naturally evolve Roaches to this new strain overtime.

Button/Tooltip/BWSentry=<c val="ffff8a">Robotic support unit. Can use Shield Recharge, Guardian Shield, and Forcefield. </c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">None</c><n/><n/>Used to support zealots in light of the protoss race's diminishing population, sentries are protoss support drones.  Prototype sentries are equipped with a portable shield battery, offering the ability to replenish shields in the battlefield.  Sentries also offer protection through guardian shields, created by weaving light into a semi-solid state. Through this, the sentry can surround itself with an area-encompassing shield to safeguard protoss ground forces. Projectiles or energy blasts that penetrate the field lose some of their kinetic or thermal energy, and part of their effectiveness. Due to its considerable coverage radius, the guardian shield is not powerful enough to make much of a difference against larger types of ordnance.<n/><n/>Sentries can also project force field barriers to stall or split up opposing forces.This is done by turning bursts of energy into a small, impenetrable barrier to hinder, block, or funnel the advance of enemy troops. While creatures or machines of prodigious size can shatter the cohesion of these translucent force fields, ordinary soldiers and vehicles become fodder to protoss ranged weapons.

Button/Tooltip/BWStalker=<c val="ffff8a">Ranged attack strider. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite"> Particle Disruptors</c><n/><n/>The fall of Aiur demonstrated to the Dark Templar that more than just stealth and guile were required to defeat the zerg. Hence, the Dark Templar developed the stalker, a war machine inspired by the Khalai dragoon. While dragoons were piloted by crippled protoss warriors, the stalker is controlled by the shadow-essence of a Dark Templar warrior fused into a metal body.  Nerazim who control stalkers undergo this process voluntarily, said process involving a Void-powered ritual which fuses their shadow essence to the machine. This gives them a preternatural degree of control over their new bodies.  Stalkers draw their psionic power from their host's connection to the Void, and are armed with carapace-mounted particle disruptors adept against both ground and aerial targets. Stalkers have been credited with many fantastic powers since their battlefield dÃ©but. However, only one is witnessed consistently: an ability to instantly teleport, or "blink", from one spot to another.  This ability requires augmentation to a stalker, through the implementation of a device called a Void displacer. When enabled, the displacer grants stalkers the ability to fade and materialize instantly at a different location, affording them an unprecedented degree of mobility, perfect for quick strikes against the enemy.<n/><n/>Stalkers were in use by the Daelaam as early as 2502 and the technology stolen and replicated by the Tal'darim shortly thereafter. Some Tal'darim voluntarily chose to become stalkers in order to better hunt and kill their foes because they only wished to sharpen their combat skills and serve their Highlord, as not all Tal'darim seek ascension.

Button/Tooltip/BWVespeneGeyser=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Workers can harvest vespene gas from this Vespene Geyser.</c><n/><n/>Vespene gas has an unusually high potential energy rating, and as such it is highly valued for use as a fuel in high-performance engines and energy reactors. The Zerg have adapted themselves to use raw Vespene as a source of nourishment to drive their greatly accelerated metabolisms. Even the Protoss require Vespene to work as a catalyst for their psi-driven machines. Geysers of this powerful green gas can be found on many planets along the Rim, and several space stations have been built over Vespene-rich asteroid belts. A refinery of some sort must be built over an active geyser to process and package the gas for its collection by the different species.<n/><n/>While an individual geyser has an effectively unlimited amount of gas within it, after a certain point the geyser âcollapsesâ and only trace amounts of Vespene can be refined from it. Most commanders would do well to seek fresh geysers to ensure that they have enough fuel to maintain their military.

A set of thrusters in the Viking's underbelly, which allow for hover/VTOL capabilities, and four low bypass turbines generate propulsion during flight.<n/><n/>Recent studies in the Viking prototypes have seen similarities in support functionalities between it and the Goliath.  Teams of engineers have been fervorously working to see if the Viking and Goliath can be interchanged, or modified, to contain "moving" internal parts where, similar to a siege tank design, it can switch simultaneously between its flight "fighter" mode and the goliath like "assault" mode.  For now, this design remains in testing/theory stages.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Prismatic Beam</c><n/><n/>During Ulrezaj's attack on the protoss on Shakuras, many of his followers stole prototype designs for new vessels, namely and most significantly, the Void Ray.  When the Tal'darim approached Ulrezaj's followers they were most interested in this Nerazim technology and acquired the designs for their own use.<n/><n/>The void ray is built around a prismatic core an oblong crystal of synthetic origin that serves as a virtually eternal power source. The core derives its energy from both the Void and Khala, focusing them through phase crystals, and forming a self-sustaining reaction.  <n/><n/>As the Tal'darim do not utilize the Khala, they have been so far unable to circumvent a design flaw which prevents their stolen void ray's from locking onto a target and enhancing their projectors to grow more powerful over time.  The Tal'darim highlord has decreed their engineers must repair this issue shortly, or they will suffer dire consequences.

Its hull is a conductive framework that can absorb most types of energy by disspating the energy of incoming strikes across the hull. It houses thousands of psionic micro-receptors, which channel the power of the prism's crystal core and project "wings" laced with psionic energies. An automated vessel, the warp prism is controlled by a robotic mind created through a psionic manufacturing process. Though fragile, no protoss fleet is complete without them.<n/><n/>The protoss use warp prisms in several ways. The primary function of a warp prism is to transport protoss forces on the battlefield. On reaching the desired destination the operation is reversed and the stored energy signatures are reconfigured into matter in proximity to the warp prism.  A secondary but no less vital function of the warp prism is to act as a mobile focus for the protoss psionic matrix. Opening a containment field around its power core, once the prism is deployed it can power protoss structures around it. In this configuration warp prisms can be used to temporarily replace destroyed pylons in a colony or enable the rapid establishment of a forward base of operations.

Skin/Info/BWAdept=Highly trained battlefield commanders, adepts utilize Purifier technology to amplify their psionic potential. They are capable of projecting shades of themselves and teleporting across great distances.
Skin/Info/BWAdeptCE=The Daelaam's starforges may be capable of reconstructing the Purifier ordnance from Glacius, but they have yet to match the optimal performance of Karax's original prototypes.
Skin/Info/BWAdeptGolden=Nostalgic sentiment has been growing among the templar after the End War. Some adepts show their pride by wearing formal ceremonial armor from bygone days. 
Skin/Info/BWAdeptIhanrii=Even battle-hardened Ihan-rii adepts needed time to get their bearings after a distress signal woke them from deep stasis on the fringes of the Koprulu Sector.
Skin/Info/BWAdeptPurifier=Refined by Phase-smith Karax, these AI warriors have become central figures in Purifier armies, impressing all who see them with their agility and refinement.
Skin/Info/BWAdeptTaldarim=Despite its recent development, the psionic amplification technology used by the Daelaam's adepts has already been reverse engineered by the Tal'darim and equipped on their most promising warriors.
Skin/Info/BWArchon=Archons boast overwhelming psionic power, but it comes at a high cost. Two templar must sacrifice themselves for an archon to be formed, making each one an embodiment of unparalleled heroism.
Skin/Info/BWArmory=The armory is built around several turbines. These keep the building within temperature specifications while researchers work tirelessly to improve terran war machinery.
Skin/Info/BWArmoryCovertOps=The Dominion's latest advances in neosteel armor were developed through the molecular examination of xel'naga constructs recovered by special forces teams.
Skin/Info/BWArmorySilver=Reports of protoss wandering into Tyrador IX's armories led to accusations of espionage, though Ihan-rii leadership insisted that these incidents were the result of settlers mistaking the gleaming structures for terran museums.
Skin/Info/BWAssimilator=Even the highly advanced protoss appreciate the myriad applications of vespene gas. They developed assimilators to harvest this useful resource.
Skin/Info/BWAssimilatorForged=Tal'darim assimilators greedily wrench vespene gas from the ground, triggering earthquakes that decimate surrounding ecosystems.
Skin/Info/BWAssimilatorIhanrii=The Ihan-rii protoss consider themselves very generous for allowing terrans to continue living on, let alone mining vespene gas from, their ancient and sacred homeworld, which they call Arakyr.
Skin/Info/BWAssimilatorTaldarim=[ph] AssimilatorTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWBaneling=First observed during the Siege of Cask, the baneling is a highly volatile and explosive combat strain evolved from the zergling. Few materials can resist the acidic burst released upon their detonation.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingMecha=The recreation of the baneling posed a unique problem for engineers, as their carefully harvested acid sacs kept melting through the surrounding plate infrastructure. Eventually, they made it work.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingNest=The zerg hive cluster must have a baneling nest to add the baneling breed's genetic code. Once a nest is in place, any zergling on the field can be commanded to form a fleshy chrysalis for a brief pupation state, and then it will burst forth as a baneling--a foul, bloated creature with bulbous, acid-filled green sacs pulsating on its back.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingNestMecha=The upper half of the Simulant baneling nest is held aloft by the same antigravity technology deployed in terran battlecruisers.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingNestRCZ=To trigger the collapse of key terran fortifications, Cerberus baneling nests have been rigged to detonate in cave networks across Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingPrimal=Inspired by the banelings in Kerrigan's Swarm, Dehaka has encouraged the mutation of a similar strain of creatures within his pack.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingRCZ=The return on investment for replacing a baneling's entire nervous system, only to have it immediately blow up, is dubious. Luckily, Cerberus's clients have quite a lot of money to spend.
Skin/Info/BWBanelingWebby=The spine-like growths of Leviathan Brood zerglings remain present on the acid sacs of their banelings. Even a total metamorphosis is incapable of changing the chaotic nature of their core essence.
Skin/Info/BWBanshee=Procyon Industries designed banshees to be both economical and effective. Built specifically to provide air support for frontline infantry, they are ideal aircraft for tactical strikes.
Skin/Info/BWBansheeCovertOps=Dominion engineers have made critical upgrades in the banshee's twin VTOL turbofans, enabling superior stability and performance when paired with the new vertical stabilizer in the rear of the craft.
Skin/Info/BWBansheeJunker=Mercenaries are infamous for cobbling together pieces of equipment on their machinery, and these banshees are no exception. Rumor has it that some bulldozer parts are involved in this particular design.
Skin/Info/BWBansheeSilver=Though most Tyrador banshees were wiped out in the first wave of the Cerberus zerg attack, one seasoned pilot managed to take down three ultralisks first. 
Skin/Info/BWBansheeUmojan=Through a series of backdoor deals, the Umojan Protectorate has been able to acquire a limited number of banshees from Procyon Industries, although the company maintains that they were stolen.
Skin/Info/BWBarracks=A home-away-from-home for terran infantry personnel, terran barracks are sterile, mobile, and capable of efficient deployment.
Skin/Info/BWBarracksCovertOps=A liquid nitrogen cooling system gives the special forces barracks an eerie blue glow. 
Skin/Info/BWBarracksSilver=Each Knights of Tyrador barracks features a five-star robotic kitchen and a full-service spa--for officers only, of course.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiser=Battlecruisers often serve as mobile command headquarters during extended military campaigns. They are flying fortresses outfitted with heavy armor and imposing weaponry.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiserCovertOps=After a lengthy research and development process, the newly upgraded Moirai class battlecruisers were approved for exclusive use by Dominion Special Forces.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiserJunker=These ferocious vessels have been modified to suit the mercenaries' preferences. However, few onlookers live long enough to admire their handiwork.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiserRemastered=The command decks of Brood War-era battlecruisers had a lower profile, with port and starboard viewdecks to ensure maximum visibility in the event of a zerg ambush.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiserSilver=Assailed by Cerberus zerg, the Knights of Tyrador dispatched a Behemoth-class battlecruiser to request aid from the stone ships waiting in silent orbit.
Skin/Info/BWBattlecruiserUmojan=Umojan battlecruisers feature redesigned neosteel plating, as well as refinements to the Yamato cannons that make them particularly distinctive in battles.
Skin/Info/BWBroodLord=Evolved to rule the skies, the brood lords are terrifying creatures that hurl their destructive broodlings at enemy forces.
Skin/Info/BWBroodLordMecha=Upon completing the brood lord prototype which exceeded all standards, the team of Project Simulant scientists were sent on leave for a celebratory vacation. Strangely, they never returned...
Skin/Info/BWBroodLordPrimal=A small number of brood lords have been integrated into primal zerg packs, resulting in a strikingly different creature most notable for its unusual claws.
Skin/Info/BWBroodLordRCZ=Each broodling dispatched from the Cerberus brood lord can be controlled individually by a commander safe at a computer console, far away from the actual battle.
Skin/Info/BWBroodLordWebby=Despite their late introduction into the Swarm, many brood lords still bear the Leviathan Brood's signature genetic traits--likely a sign of early essence experimentation by the evolution master, Abathur.
Skin/Info/BWBroodLord_PremiumSkin_Aquatic=While infesting a planet with exceptionally large seas, some brood lords took to the water and evolved the ability to dive deep into the trenches while devouring their prey.
Skin/Info/BWBunker=Due to its ubiquity and lack of amenities, terran infantry commonly refer to bunkers as "battlefield coffins."
Skin/Info/BWBunkerCovertOps=The next-generation Dominion bunker can withstand the full weight of an ultralisk, but what most marines are excited about is the fact that it comes with chairs.
Skin/Info/BWBunkerSilver=Tyrador's supercooled bunkers make for comfortable reconnaissance, even in sweltering tropical vacation zones.
Skin/Info/BWCarrier=These magnificent capital ships are known to inspire hope in the hearts of the templar--or fear in their enemies. Armed with swift interceptors, they are a formidable force on the battlefield.
Skin/Info/BWCarrierGolden=A small number of carriers have been rebuilt using ancient techniques to better resemble their counterparts from the period after the Aeon of Strife. They are primarily used for diplomatic visits.
Skin/Info/BWCarrierIhanrii=The animated stone developed by the Ihan-rii protoss is light, durable, and chemically inert, making it the perfect material for massive deep-space ships.
Skin/Info/BWCarrierPurifier=The Purifier carrier is a streamlined creation that perfectly combines automation expertise with the deadliest of drone weapons.
Skin/Info/BWCarrierRemastered=Carriers modeled after legendary flagship Gantrithor continue to be built in certain corners of Protoss space, to honor Tassadar and the sacrifice he made.
Skin/Info/BWCarrierTaldarim=Tal'darim shipwrights excel at repurposing khalai engineering for bloodshed. The carriers that make up the majority of the death fleet are warships through and through.
Skin/Info/BWCarrier_AmonBrood_Collection=Amon corrupted a large portion of the Golden Armada, using their warriors as his own. These possessed protoss took on a different appearance due to the Void energy, and their ships were likewise changed.
Skin/Info/BWColossus=Colossi were the first protoss robots designed solely for destruction. They are both a symbol of a bloody history and a necessary weapon to secure a peaceful future.
Skin/Info/BWColossusCE=Deemed too dangerous for use after the Kalath Intercession, the Purifier program's colossi are legendary among the Templar's warriors. These are the ultimate purification machines.
Skin/Info/BWColossusGolden=Selected colossi that saw combat in the End War have been remodeled in a traditionalist style using the finest materials available. They now resemble the grandest of ancient protoss robotics.
Skin/Info/BWColossusIhanrii=The many stone components of the Ihan-rii colossus are levitated and held together by void energies emanated from repurposed xel'naga dynamos.
Skin/Info/BWColossusPurifier=The latest in Purifier engineering has yielded a sleek, subtly enhanced colossus that is nonetheless a brutal war machine.
Skin/Info/BWColossusTal=Relics of wars long over, colossi that lay buried and forgotten across the sector are often unearthed and reactivated by Tal'darim ascendants who seek superior firepower.
Skin/Info/BWColossusTaldarim=Lower ranking ascendants often dare each other to disable and commandeer an active colossus. If one succeeds, the Tal'darim gain a powerful war machine. If not, a rival ascendant has been eliminated.
Skin/Info/BWCommandCenter=Mobile and practical, command centers are resource processors that can relocate to wherever minerals or vespene gas are plentiful.
Skin/Info/BWCommandCenterCovertOps=Reinforced repulsor landing claws help this command center find solid footing in even the harshest environments.
Skin/Info/BWCommandCenterRemastered=Previous iterations of the command center had an extensible interface in order to connect with external add-ons. These were later replaced with internal bays for increased security.
Skin/Info/BWCommandCenterSilver=After the arrival of the Ihan-rii protoss, Tyrador's command centers played host to diplomatic envoys from around the Koprulu Sector, each intent on recruiting the newcomers to their own specific political agenda.
Skin/Info/BWCorruptor=Held aloft by a biologically produced electromagnetic field, corruptors can spray a stream of caustic acid that eats through even the most durable of construction materials.
Skin/Info/BWCorruptorMecha=Rather than spores, these mechanical corruptors possess self-replicating nanites that have been programmed to perform the same function, disturbingly enough.
Skin/Info/BWCorruptorPrimal=The original corruptors have the distinction of being adapted by both the Swarm and the primal zerg. The latter have adapted thicker claws and carapaces to assist with their rigorous feeding process.
Skin/Info/BWCorruptorRCZ=Driven underground after the fall of Arcturus Mengsk, the Cerberus Program evolved their neural reprogramming initiative, targeting zerg instead of terran soldiers.
Skin/Info/BWCorruptorWebby=While hardened spines and webbed features often suggest an aquatic background, the Leviathan Brood's corruptors adapted them to survive in high gravity environments.
Skin/Info/BWCreepTumorMecha=Sophisticated nanotechnology must lie at the heart of creep tumors created by rogue Simulant queens, though further investigation has been stymied by the tumors' tendency to detonate when cut open.
Skin/Info/BWCyberneticsCore=The protoss are known to pair elite fallen warriors with artificial bodies, granting them a second life in glorious combat. The cybernetics core plays a large role in developing this technology.
Skin/Info/BWCyberneticsCoreForged=All cybernetics cores possess the ability to bind biological beings to elaborate machinery; in Tal'darim cybernetics cores, the main difference is that the process is unimaginably painful.
Skin/Info/BWCyberneticsCoreIhanrii=Terran recon of Ihan-rii settlements yielded footage of a structure resembling the contemporary protoss cybernetics core, though the energies produced by the Ihan-rii version were wildly different.
Skin/Info/BWCyclone=Originally intended to be fully automated, this mobile assault vehicle was redesigned to accommodate a pilot. After all, nothing can match the unpredictability of a human driver.
Skin/Info/BWCycloneCovertOps=This vehicle has undergone extensive redesigns to increase its maneuverability in special forces missions, including exposed treads that will cross difficult terran and small spaces more readily.
Skin/Info/BWCycloneJunker=Mira's mercs have significantly bulked up their cyclones, adding extra plating and a generous number of spikes. However, due to their hasty engineering, its ability to absorb damage remains the same.
Skin/Info/BWCycloneSilver=When the Cerberus zerg attacked Tyrador IX, a few cyclones sent to defend were still armed with harmless fireworks used for nightly amusement park displays.
Skin/Info/BWCycloneUmojan=If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then these cyclones are the Umojan engineers' elaborate tribute to the ingenuity of the Terran Dominion.
Skin/Info/BWDarkShrine=The dark shrine once stood as a monument to the independent society of the Nerazim. After the rejoining the khalai, the Nerazim repurposed it as a training ground for dark templar.
Skin/Info/BWDarkShrineForged=None but the blood hunters, enforcers of the Highlords' malevolent will, know what transpires within the Tal'darim dark shrine.
Skin/Info/BWDarkShrineIhanrii=The superheated fumes venting from the top of the Ihan-rii dark shrine suggest infernal internal temperatures, though terran thermal analysis indicates the animated stone exterior is near-freezing.
Skin/Info/BWDarkTemplar=Powerful psionic warriors of the Nerazim, dark templar have learned how to manipulate the powers of the Void. They strike from the shadows, deadly and relentless.
Skin/Info/BWDarkTemplarGolden=Templar traditionalists claim to have befriended a few of the Nerazim, boasting that these individuals are the true symbol of the Daelaam. Others say they were merely bribed.
Skin/Info/BWDarkTemplarIhanrii=Early in their training, Ihan-rii protoss are bound to a void crystal that resonates with their unique psionic signature. Once they reach adulthood, this crystal is sharpened into a deadly spearpoint.
Skin/Info/BWDarkTemplarPurifier=After increased interaction with the Nerazim, the Purifiers have designed a new variant on the sentinel that mimics the combat prowess of Dark Templar warriors.
Skin/Info/BWDarkTemplarTaldarim=Tal'darim society is brutal and unforgiving. Those deemed too weak to be of service to their Highlord are ruthlessly hunted down and executed by the blood hunters, who stalk their prey unseen.
Skin/Info/BWDisruptor=Originally developed as part of the Purifier program, disruptors are among the deadliest of protoss armaments. Their solarite arsenal is capable of immense devastation.
Skin/Info/BWDisruptorGolden=Much like the colossi, disruptors that saw combat in the End War have been refurbished as reminders of the protoss' moments of victory. Perhaps with time, the memories of their losses will fade.
Skin/Info/BWDisruptorIhanrii=Ihan-rii disruptors draw crackling green energy directly from the crystal cores of their capital ships. Anything biological that makes contact with the central power conduit is promptly vaporized.
Skin/Info/BWDisruptorPurifier=The latest disruptors from Cybros feature advanced plating and protocol refinements that reflect their investment in ongoing research.
Skin/Info/BWDisruptorTaldarim=The Tal'darim often scoff at the Daelaam's choice of weaponry, but they were quick to seize and repurpose as many disruptors as they could. Such destructive power is too great to ignore.
Skin/Info/BWDrone=Single-minded and diligent, drones hold within their genetic code the evolutionary potential of all zerg structures. All they require are resources and creep to nourish their added biomass.
Skin/Info/BWDroneBlizzcon17=This unusual drone hatched amid a pile of rusting terran wreckage. Rather than suffering from the interference, its flesh adapted to fuse itself to the rubble.
Skin/Info/BWDroneMecha=The Simulant Project began with the construction of a mechanical drone that could be used during target practice to test alternate combat techniques and weapons, but it soon grew much larger.
Skin/Info/BWDronePrimal=Primal drones often find themselves in a perilous position, as stronger members of their packs have been known to feed on them when they require additional nourishment.
Skin/Info/BWDroneRCZ=Like the rest of the Cerberus zerg, this drone's nervous system has been replaced with cybernetic technology, enabling full musculoskeletal control.
Skin/Info/BWDroneRemastered=Earlier evolutions of the drone had more vibrant coloration and increased aggression reflexes that gradually disappeared within the population in the following years.
Skin/Info/BWDroneWebby=Poisonous fin rays are a universal defense mechanism signaling predators to stay away. Some creatures merely mimic their deadly appearance to discourage unwanted aggression.
Skin/Info/BWEngineeringBay=The terrans heavily developed their engineering capabilities after the Brood War. Due to the increase in personnel and the intricacy of their work, the engineering bay is no longer cleared for flight.
Skin/Info/BWEngineeringBayCovertOps=Experimental engineering bays increase research speed by pitting rival AIs against one another in simulated battle.
Skin/Info/BWEngineeringBaySilver=A portion of each Knights of Tyrador engineering bay is devoted to concocting new amusement park attractions, though this policy has been temporarily suspended in wake of the Cerberus zerg assault.
Skin/Info/BWEvolutionChamber=Genetic sequences twist and merge within the evolution chamber, generating improvements to the zerg army.Â 
Skin/Info/BWEvolutionChamberMecha=Like other Simulant structures, the evolution chamber is constructed from a polymeric alloy capable of flexing to accommodate the roiling biomechanical processes within.
Skin/Info/BWEvolutionChamberRCZ=After months of frustration in the Cerberus bioengineering department, it was discovered that pumping an evolution chamber's arteries full of command pheromones could just about tame the structure's hyperadaptive tendencies.
Skin/Info/BWExtractor=This is a biological structure that digests vespene gas before excreting it in small flesh sacs. These sacs are perfectly designed to be easily transportable by a drone.
Skin/Info/BWExtractorMecha=Planning documents indicate that the Simulant Project's extractors were intended to be purely decorative. It remains unclear when they shifted into full vespene production.
Skin/Info/BWExtractorRCZ=Cerberus extractors pulse unremittingly beneath Tyrador IX's surface, leeching every trace of vespene gas from the planet's crust to power further expansion.
Skin/Info/BWFactory=During the Second Great War, latrines were removed from factories. This extra space allowed mechanics to deploy siege tanks with siege capabilities already installed.
Skin/Info/BWFactoryCovertOps=The R36-series factory features sturdier anchors, a reinforced foundation, and bulletproof coat of paint.
Skin/Info/BWFactorySilver=Settlement negotiations between the Ihan-rii protoss and Tyrador IX's leaders hit a snag when several terran factories in a disputed area mysteriously exploded, leaving glowing green craters.
Skin/Info/BWFleetBeacon=Fleet beacons serve to strengthen the connection of any nearby stargate to the psionic matrix, enabling the warp transport of massive capital ships.
Skin/Info/BWFleetBeaconForged=The Tal'darim fleet beacon forces an almost certainly inadvisable amount of psionic energy through its central sphere, enabling the teleportation of massive and heavily armored warships.
Skin/Info/BWFleetBeaconIhanrii=Back on Arakyr at last, the Ihan-rii built powerful fleet beacons to scan the depths of space for other survivors of their ancient civilization.
Skin/Info/BWFleetBeaconTaldarim=[ph] FleetBeaconTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWForge=The forge houses phase-smiths working tirelessly to improve the weapons, armor, and ships of their brethren. These elite engineers will not rest until the day Aiur is reclaimed.
Skin/Info/BWForgeForged=Inside Tal'darim forges, captured Khalai engineers are interrogated for their technological secrets. 
Skin/Info/BWForgeIhanrii=The Ihan-rii mine void crystals from veins along Arakyr's southern pole, storing them vacuum-sealed in their forges' deepest chambers.
Skin/Info/BWForgeTaldarim=[ph] ForgeTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWFusionCore=The work undertaken in the fusion core is extremely delicate. Researchers here harness antimatter and nuclear power to increase battlecruiser capability.
Skin/Info/BWFusionCoreCovertOps=To accommodate the new Moirai-class battlecruiser, the fusion core's energy output was quadrupled without increasing its heat signature.
Skin/Info/BWFusionCoreSilver=In addition to supporting the orbital battlecruiser fleet, liquid-cooled fusion cores provide most of the power for Tyrador IX's casinos, water parks, and robotic massage parlors.
Skin/Info/BWGateway=Following the Brood War, the protoss reverse engineered the ancient warp technology of the xel'naga. Gateways can now transport warriors to distant battlefields within seconds.
Skin/Info/BWGatewayForged=The Tal'darim gateway can warp warriors from much further away than its Khalai counterparts. One downside of the additional power is that passengers are occasionally torn to bits en route.
Skin/Info/BWGatewayIhanrii=Interspecies relations on Tyrador IX faced their toughest test yet when a terran dignitary visiting an Ihan-rii settlement touched a gateway and was immediately (and messily) vaporized by excess void energies.
Skin/Info/BWGatewayTaldarim=[ph] GatewayTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWGhost=The ultimate terran covert operatives, ghosts harness their innate psionic potential to enhance their lethal skill sets. They are unrivaled in their ability to infiltrate and assassinate.
Skin/Info/BWGhostAcademy=After forming the Dominion, Mengsk sought to overhaul the ghost program. Dedicated ghost academies with attached nuclear silos were erected in order to fully harness this potential.
Skin/Info/BWGhostAcademyCovertOps=Newer ghost academies have ameliorated the issue of radiation leaking from nuclear silos into the neighboring training areas.
Skin/Info/BWGhostAcademySilver=When it was discovered that Cerberus was responsible for the invasion of remote-control zerg, the Knights of Tyrador recruited mercenary ghosts to track down and assassinate the rogue corporation's leadership.
Skin/Info/BWGhostCovertOps=Emperor Valerian has initiated various changes in the ghost program in recent years, resulting in better, more committed recruits who serve of their own free will.
Skin/Info/BWGhostEidolon=Few ghosts manage to survive the rigors of the program long enough to call themselves veterans, but those who do gain access to the highly exclusive Eidolon suits.
Skin/Info/BWGhostJunker=Despite her charismatic personality, Mira Han has had nothing but trouble recruiting and retaining ghosts among her crew. Perhaps they prefer more sophisticated weaponry than mercs can offer.
Skin/Info/BWGhostNova=All ghosts are deadly covert operatives, but those who graduate at the head of their class are the deadliest. These elite assassins are at the center of countless battlefield operations.
Skin/Info/BWGhostSilver=Elite ghosts guard Tyrador's most valuable tourists. Their visors were discontinued after a visiting rock star complained that "the masks freak me out, man."
Skin/Info/BWGhostUmojan=Known as shadowguards, these elite operatives are employed to keep the secrets of the Umojan Protectorate, as well as the peace.
Skin/Info/BWGreaterSpireMecha=Officially, the Simulant Project never completed a replica of the greater spire. Photographs suggesting the contrary have been dismissed as elaborate fakes by Dominion representatives.
Skin/Info/BWHatchery=Every colony needs a heart. From digesting minerals to creating larva to generating creep, hatcheries hold the genetic blueprints for the zerg.
Skin/Info/BWHatcheryMecha=By the time the Simulant Project's replica hatcheries began mysteriously producing a substance indistinguishable from creep, the directors had bigger problems to worry about. 
Skin/Info/BWHatcheryRCZ=After verifying that their infiltration of Tyrador IX's subterranean environment had escaped detection, Cerberus began seeding the planet's extensive lava tubes with remote-operated hatcheries.
Skin/Info/BWHatcheryRemastered=The zerg broodmothers vied for dominance over one another in the absence of the Queen of Blades. Many of those who were weak were displaced from their colonies and perished. Others discovered abandoned, dormant hatcheries and set to work raising new broods.
Skin/Info/BWHellion=High-speed raiders with lightweight chassis, hellions excel at lightning-fast strike missions and evasive maneuvering. They are particularly popular with mercenary companies.
Skin/Info/BWHellionCovertOps=Refined to utilize a bold, three-wheel design, this hellion is sleeker and easier to steer than ever before. Word among the drivers is that it's even more fun, too.
Skin/Info/BWHellionJunker=Originally modified for underground demolition leagues, these Hellions have become the preferred vehicles of the fringe worlds' notorious junker gangs.
Skin/Info/BWHellionJunkerMM=These hellions were made to get their drivers out of bad situations quickly and look good in the process. They may also have illegal stim emitters, but the mercs are tight-lipped about them.
Skin/Info/BWHellionSilver=The stylish chrome rims on the Tyrador hellion were designed in collaboration with street racer-turned-fashion icon JJ Hyun.
Skin/Info/BWHellionUmojan=Umojans drive in style thanks to their sophisticated hellions, which sport improved suspension, defensive plating, and even more comfortable seats for their drivers.
Skin/Info/BWHighTemplar=The high templar are the most respected and experienced warriors of the protoss race. Having honed their psionic abilities to an awe-inspiring degree, their minds are their greatest weapon.
Skin/Info/BWHighTemplarGolden=The Shelak high templar were the first to wear ancient armor in recognition of Khas and his role in uniting the templar. By embracing the glorious past, they quiet their fears about the troubled future.
Skin/Info/BWHighTemplarIhanrii=Unable to reach the "Zeratul" whose distress signal had wrested them from deep stasis, the Ihan-rii protoss made their way to the system that, long ago, they had called home. 
Skin/Info/BWHighTemplarPurifier=After extensive experimentation, the Purifiers have perfected AI warriors that possess the same distinctive abilities as the high templar in the Daelaam. Hierarch Artanis himself is said to be impressed.
Skin/Info/BWHighTemplarTaldarim=Through Rak'Shir, the Tal'darim climb the Chain of Ascension. Years of absorbing terrazine and the essence of their supplicants have made these ascendants powerful indeed.
Skin/Info/BWHiveMecha=The further mutation of several Simulant Project lairs into full-blown hives would probably have triggered a fastidious investigation if anybody had still been around to perform one.
Skin/Info/BWHydralisk=Evolved to be nightmarish killers, hydralisks boast robust musculature that allows them to eject the spines between their carapace plating with such speed that they can puncture neosteel.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskDen=The zerg took the structure of the peaceful slothien and evolved it to create the hydralisk den. Over time, it has developed a biological exoskeleton to protect its flesh.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskDenMecha=Investigators were never able to ascertain the purpose of the deadly vanadium blades sprouting from the hydralisk den, nor the individual responsible for placing them there.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskDenRCZ=Abandoning the invasion of Tyrador IX was never an option for Cerberus, which needs to demonstrate metrics like "+20% hydralisk production efficiency in real-world scenarios" to earn out its funding agreements.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskMecha=Simulant hydralisks posed a significant risk to their creators, who chose to replace their claws with blades that could be easily dulled during the assembly process.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskNoxious=Though the noxious strain of zerg first emerged in ultralisks, it has since spread to include hydralisks as well. These specimens have inherited the strain's signature toxic characteristics, along with a more ferocious appearance.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskPrimal=Swarm hydralisks were quickly integrated into primal zerg packs, where they kept many of their original traits. Clearly this is a testament to their evolutionary strength.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskRCZ=Cerberus hydralisks penetrated New Canaan's defense perimeter during a dust storm, when their luminescent eyes were mistaken for dune buggy headlights.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskRemastered=Earlier Hydralisk evolutions were characterized by slimmer spikes and an imposing, colorful crest.
Skin/Info/BWHydraliskWebby=Hydralisks of the Leviathan Brood never lost the genetic sequences necessary to metamorphize into lurkers. Indeed, elements of the lurkers' appearance are woven directly into their DNA.
Skin/Info/BWImmortal=When revered protoss heroes fall, their remains are transplanted into robotic exoskeletons. These heavily armed and shielded immortals are among the most loyal of warriors.
Skin/Info/BWImmortalAdun=To the protoss, there is no greater honor than self-sacrifice. Adun understood this most of all, and it is in his name that the immortals are consecrated.
Skin/Info/BWImmortalGolden=After the End War, some fallen templar elected to be placed into ancient immortal exoskeletons to show their dedication to the ideals that united the protoss in times of trouble.
Skin/Info/BWImmortalIhanrii=Ihan-rii heroes who die honorably are interred in four-legged robotic sarcophagi, which carry their remains to future battles, armed with tremendous cannons.
Skin/Info/BWImmortalPurifier=In the aftermath of the End War, the Purifiers have been able to repurpose the shells of deceased immortals so they can continue functioning as purely robotic fighters.
Skin/Info/BWImmortalTaldarim=Encased within armored assault frames, Tal'darim warriors who are felled in failure and disgrace seek the opportunity to erase their shame. Their hope is to die well in service of their Highlord.
Skin/Info/BWInfestationPit=The infestation pit is where genetics run wild, cultivating a vast array of diseases, plague cells, and neural parasites. Only the most efficient of these maladies are utilized by infestors.Â 
Skin/Info/BWInfestationPitMecha=The first suggestion of a Simulant Project AI malfunction came when the infestor den stopped responding to its maintenance technicians.
Skin/Info/BWInfestationPitRCZ=Neural parasites from judiciously distributed infestation pits ensure that any adventurous spelunkers who happen across Cerberus-occupied lava tubes report technical difficulties, then are never heard from again.
Skin/Info/BWInfestor=True to their name, infestors spread the Swarm's influence wherever they go. Organisms that are injected with an infestor's neural parasites become the zerg's mindless soldiers.
Skin/Info/BWInfestorMecha=Researchers failed to create an AI that replicated the infestors' neural parasites. They were removing the infestors from production when, unexpectedly, the parasites' AI began functioning perfectly...
Skin/Info/BWInfestorPrimal=As frequent targets of larger, more vicious competitors within their pack, primal infestors have evolved thickened plating along their back to protect themselves. 
Skin/Info/BWInfestorRCZ=In response to feedback from an important corporate client, Cerberus implanted the notoriously fragile infestor with supportive titanium infrastructure.
Skin/Info/BWInfestorWebby=As a colony creature, the organisms comprising the borboru matriarch took many different functions. Within Leviathan infestors, the defensive structures of the base creature are more pronounced.
Skin/Info/BWLairMecha=When the first Simulant Project hatchery mutated into a lair, an internal audit was launched, though the engineer responsible was never discovered.
Skin/Info/BWLarva=This unassuming, maggot-like organism is covered in an deceptively strong hide and capable of mutating into any number of horrors.
Skin/Info/BWLarvaMecha=Visual recognition among Simulants is a common justification for creating mecha larvae that resemble their inspirations in silhouette and gait. This doesn't entirely explain why Simulant Project engineers felt it necessary to replicate the zerg larva's signature squelching noises.
Skin/Info/BWLarvaRCZ=Cerberus invested a great deal of effort in mapping unique and often painful stimuli to the metamorphoses of the zerg larva in which they resulted.
Skin/Info/BWLiberator=Inspired by the UEDâs valkyries, liberators were originally designed to combat aerial threats. The addition of air-to-ground artillery allows them to also deal with terrestrial enemy forces.
Skin/Info/BWLiberatorCovertOps=Recent improvements in neosteel construction have led to more complex plating designs that augment the liberator's transformation process, making it the envy of the Dominion fleet.
Skin/Info/BWLiberatorJunker=Mira Han won all of her liberators in just one incredibly dramatic poker game. Unfortunately, she lost them all to a rival mercenary just a short time later.
Skin/Info/BWLiberatorSilver=Liberators on Tyrador IX are equipped with numerous front-facing floodlights, increasing visibility during late-night patrols of the planet's stunning wilderness. 
Skin/Info/BWLiberatorUmojan=It only took a few years for the Umojan Protectorate to unleash its version of the famous Liberator. Its wholly re-imagined rear thrusters have become the envy of the Terran Dominion engineering team.
Skin/Info/BWLurker=The lurker was believed lost until its sequences were recovered from a feral hive cluster. Now, the lurkers serve the Swarm once again, annihilating their foes from the darkness below.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerDen=From a distance, the lurker den appears to be more bone than flesh. Upon closer inspection, the exterior is more like a grooved, thick leather.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerDenMecha=The process of forging nano-tipped lurker spines generates tremendous heat, which the Simulant lurker den dissipates through a convoluted network of vents and cooling fins.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerDenRCZ=Anticipating the need for advance lookouts and a stealthy first line of defense, Cerberus produced an abundance of lurker dens to support their infestation of Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerMecha=Extensive subterranean tests yielded a capable mechanized lurker, aside from its spikes, which were reshaped to better perform under blunt force impact.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerPrimal=Some of the primal hydralisks developed mutations that led them to exhibit an increasing number of lurker characteristics. At this point, they resemble lurkers more than their hydralisk ancestors.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerRCZ=A company of Ihan-rii protoss dispatched to investigate the surface of Tyrador IX were  massacred by Cerberus lurkers that happened to be burrowed at the landing site.
Skin/Info/BWLurkerWebby=The innate connection between hydralisks and lurkers within the Leviathan Brood is unparalleled among the Swarm. As such, their metamorphosis yields a considerable number of additional seismic spines.
Skin/Info/BWMarauder=Marauders are walking tanks, designed by the Dominion to combat the hardened carapaces of the zerg. Their grenades are effective against a variety of other targets, as well.
Skin/Info/BWMarauderCovertOps=When the Dominion Special Forces surveyed their personnel for improvements on marauder suits, only one dominated the conversation--bigger guns. The weapons researchers gladly obliged.
Skin/Info/BWMarauderDeluxe=Recent improvements to the CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit have been approved for voluntary field testing. Luckily, there are plenty of marauders in the corps who could use the credits.
Skin/Info/BWMarauderJunker=As some of the original members of Mira Han's crew, these marauders are unusually loyal compared to others in the mercenary world... or Han just has exceptionally compelling blackmail on them.
Skin/Info/BWMarauderSilver=The Tyrador marauder weighs almost twice the Dominion standard. Engineers compensated for the extra density with enhanced hydraulics and exhaust.
Skin/Info/BWMarauderUmojan=Special advancements in CMC armor have given these marauders improved night vision options, as well as a heavily reinforced upper frame to support their weightier grenade launchers. 
Skin/Info/BWMarine=Marines are the first line of defense for terran worlds across the sector. Comprised of convicts, rebels and patriots alike, they're always ready for a fight.
Skin/Info/BWMarineCovertOps=One's service in the Dominion Special Forces may not always last long, but all marines can agree that there's never a dull moment on the job.
Skin/Info/BWMarineJunker=Those who ask why these mercenaries carry bladed weapons have clearly never been in a backwater bar fight with them.
Skin/Info/BWMarineRemastered=Marines who fought in the Brood War often express nostalgia for the armor they wore back then, which they claim was significantly more comfortable.
Skin/Info/BWMarineSilver=The mercenary marines who guard Tyrador's resorts and beaches are mostly grizzled veterans lured to the system by the promise of an easy gig and generous pay.
Skin/Info/BWMarineUmojan=Umojan marines have recently seen exciting armor upgradesâofficially to increase the safety and average deployment time of recruits, but possibly as preparation for a future conflict.
Skin/Info/BWMarineXPR=Despite their reputation as heavy drinkers and barroom brawlers, the War Pigs are some of the most dependable mercenaries in the sector.
Skin/Info/BWMedivac=Functioning as both a dropship and a medical bay, medivacs allow for simultaneous troop deployment and triage, reducing the time required to redeploy wounded soldiers.
Skin/Info/BWMedivacCovertOps=In response to considerable losses on a recent covert ops mission, the Dominion leadership has approved the use of medivacs on a greater number of assignments, with the goal of reducing casualties.
Skin/Info/BWMedivacJunker=Though mercenaries are used to taking their chances in battle, occasionally their missions involve important enough personnel to merit the use of one of these customized medivacs.
Skin/Info/BWMedivacSilver=Though staffed by experienced pilots, medivacs on Tyrador IX are mostly used to rescue wealthy tourists who wreck their luxury yachts on reefs in the emerald seas.
Skin/Info/BWMedivacUmojan=The extensive medical training of medivac pilots has been credited for the longer than average soldier lifespan in the Umojan Protectorate.
Skin/Info/BWMissileTurret=Although these defensive structures are prone to breaking down, they effectively target aerial attackers and are capable of detecting hidden foes.
Skin/Info/BWMissileTurretCovertOps=Thanks to their sleek, low-profile design, special forces missile turrets often remain undetected until enemy ships are directly within their line of fire.
Skin/Info/BWMissileTurretSilver=Though the Ihan-rii claim their fast-growing void ray fleet is intended for ceremonial purposes only, the Knights of Tyrador have begun a massive expansion of their missile turret network just in case.
Skin/Info/BWMothership=The ultimate protoss vessel, Motherships serve as star-faring command centers that can single-handedly decide the outcome of a battle. They are the flagships of the Golden Armada.
Skin/Info/BWMothershipGolden=Though motherships have always been well-maintained, the revival of interest in the golden age of the Templar has resulted in a new wave of support and care for the priceless vessels.
Skin/Info/BWMothershipIhanrii=The Ihan-rii protoss believe themselves to be the only true descendants of the xel'naga, a message they convey proudly in the runes that adorn their motherships. 
Skin/Info/BWMothershipPurifier=In the interest of presenting themselves as equals to the templar, the Purifiers have begun constructing their own massive motherships.
Skin/Info/BWMothershipTaldarim=The death fleet's motherships are equipped for total battlefield domination. Each one is a throne from which a Tal'darim fleet lord oversees the ruin of their foes.
Skin/Info/BWMutalisk=Few things are as terrifying as a sky blotted out by the wings of mutalisks. The glave wurm symbiotes they expel can easily ravage entire armies from above.
Skin/Info/BWMutaliskMecha=Though the mutalisk struggled with initial weight tests, its eventual success led to many new investors for the Simulant Project--some of them with ulterior motivations.
Skin/Info/BWMutaliskPrimal=The primal mutalisks are everchanging, particularly when it comes to their wings and tails. This strain also features subdued coloring, allowing them to conceal themselves in many different environments.
Skin/Info/BWMutaliskRCZ=Swarms of Cerberus mutalisks outmaneuvered the inexperienced viking pilots defending Tyrador IX, but they faced a tougher foe when the Ihan-rii protoss descended in ancient stone ships.
Skin/Info/BWMutaliskWebby=Mutalisks comprise a vast number of the Leviathan Brood's forces. It is said that they function as one mind in battle, a singular unyielding mass that blacks out the sky.
Skin/Info/BWNexus=The nexus acts as an anchor allowing protoss to access the psionic matrix across the galaxy. Recent technological advancements have enabled these focal points to manipulate space and time itself.
Skin/Info/BWNexusForged=Long ago, the Tal'darim adapted a captured Khalai nexus to maximize its architectural brutality, with a supercharged khaydarin crystal restrained by psionic prongs at its peak. 
Skin/Info/BWNexusIhanrii=The Ihan-rii welcome terran delegations into their settlements, but never inside their imposing stone nexuses, from which strange ululations and distant heartbeat-sounds emanate.
Skin/Info/BWNexusRemastered=Following the Brood War, the Daelaam dedicated a great many phase-smiths to retrofit older nexuses with the latest chronal distortion technology.
Skin/Info/BWNydusNetwork=Nydus networks evolved from a combination of nydus canals and the desire of broodmothers to surprise and swarm. When activated by chemical stimuli, nydus networks form tunnels underground across the battlefield.
Skin/Info/BWNydusNetworkMecha=A scanner sweep conducted after the dissolution of the Simulant Project revealed a convoluted network of unauthorized nydus tunnels honeycombing the facility.
Skin/Info/BWNydusNetworkRCZ=Remote-operated nydus networks ensure that the second invasion of Tyrador IX will come from everywhere at once, hopefully facilitating an outcome more palatable to the Cerberus executive board.
Skin/Info/BWNydusWormMecha=Though the Simulant Project nydus worm lacks the original's musculoskeletal indestructibility, it smells a whole lot better inside.
Skin/Info/BWObserver=Complex sensor matrices allow observers to collect massive amounts of data in a short amount of time. The critical intelligence they provide has turned the tide of battle time and again.
Skin/Info/BWObserverGolden=Older observers had a different stabilizer configuration that, though equally effective, gave them with a more imposing aspect. Some phase-smiths claim that it also boosts performance, but this is unverified. 
Skin/Info/BWObserverIhanrii=For millennia, the Ihan-rii have deployed observers to monitor the other protoss sects and the zerg without concern of being discovered.
Skin/Info/BWObserverPurifier=Observers are greatly prized among the Purifier forces, having found especially strong favor with Fenix himself.
Skin/Info/BWObserverTaldarim=Reconnaissance is essential for effective deception and subterfuge. The most cunning ascendants make extensive use of observers to spy on Slayn's enemies... and on each other.
Skin/Info/BWOracle=During their long exile from Aiur, the Nerazim were free to experiment with new technologies. The agile oracle vessels are an excellent example of how fruitful this exploration could be.
Skin/Info/BWOracleGolden=Templar traditionalists still borrow technology from the Nerazim, choosing to change only the aesthetics to suit their preferences. Matriarch Vorazun has declined to comment on this practice.
Skin/Info/BWOracleIhanrii=The Ihan-rii dispatched oracles to investigate the Behemoth-class battlecruiser that approached them in orbit around Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BWOraclePurifier=Though initially beset by design challenges, clever phase-smiths have been able to engineer vessels similar to the Nerazim oracles.
Skin/Info/BWOracleTaldarim=The Tal'darim have long coveted the Nerazim's temporal mastery. Stolen oracles are jealously guarded by the fleet lords who control them.
Skin/Info/BWOrbitalCommandCovertOps=The cutting-edge scanners on this orbital command render most reconnaissance missions unnecessary â much to the relief of the low-ranking marines usually tasked with locating the enemy.
Skin/Info/BWOverSeerWebby=Bred to specialize in reconnaissance, the fins and tendrils of the Leviathan overseers allow them to cut through both air and water with minimal effort.
Skin/Info/BWOverlord=Overlords perform a critical function for a zerg hive cluster-- spreading creep and relaying psionic commands from a broodmother to the less evolved organisms she controls. 
Skin/Info/BWOverlordMecha=An early creation during the course of the Simulant Project, the overlord is carefully controlled by a lab scientist, making it a critical safety point in the entire operation.
Skin/Info/BWOverlordPrimal=Some primal zerg pack leaders, like Dehaka, have evolved beyond the need of overlords, but a few of them nonetheless remain as vestiges of the past.
Skin/Info/BWOverlordRCZ=Cerberus overlords use incandescent energy beacons to pinpoint positioning even in low-visibility conditions, like the dust storms and fog banks common on Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BWOverlordWebby=Overlords exert control over the minions of the zerg. As a result of their constant connection, the Leviathan Brood's overlords reflect the genetic mutations of the creatures beneath them.
Skin/Info/BWOverlordXPR=Due to their need to support many different strains of zerg at once, overlords can sometimes exhibit spontaneous adaptive mutations in an attempt to improve their own efficiency.
Skin/Info/BWOverseer=Evolved from the overlord, the overseer focuses its eyes towards scouting and revealing the presence of hidden enemies, wherever they may lurk.
Skin/Info/BWOverseerMecha=Unable to fully replicate the organic structure behind the overseer's eyes, the head engineer replaced them with detection sensors that fulfill largely the same purposeâaside from the aesthetics. 
Skin/Info/BWOverseerPrimal=One of the rarest species of primal zerg, the overseers are seldom seen. Like their Swarm counterparts, they evolved from primal overlords and possess especially keen senses.
Skin/Info/BWOverseerRCZ=The Cerberus overseer's void sensor technology was developed by one Dr. Rudolfo Subsourian. It can triangulate the exact position of a cloaking effect within 20 kilometers.
Skin/Info/BWPhoenix=Designed for aerial harassment, phoenixes are known for their unmatched speed and maneuverability. A single strike force can keep an enemy army pinned down even when vastly outnumbered.
Skin/Info/BWPhoenixGolden=The Shelak tribe has commissioned phoenixes that resemble the escort ships favored by early judicators. Though some see them as controversial symbols, others praise the beautiful craftsmanship.
Skin/Info/BWPhoenixIhanrii=Though the Ihan-rii phoenix's stone construction doesn't inhibit its maneuverability or top speed, it does make it a more formidable missile when crash-landing.
Skin/Info/BWPhoenixPurifier=When the Purifiers do not need the phasing technology of the mirages, they will deploy robotic phoenixes to defend their skies.
Skin/Info/BWPhoenixTaldarim=There is a time for overwhelming force, and a time to be swift and deadly. The Tal'darim recognize the value in the latter, which is why they maintain a fleet of phoenixes stolen from the Templar.
Skin/Info/BWPhotonCannon=Protoss phase-smiths can outfit their defensive structures with powerful antimatter cannons and advanced detection measures. Experiments integrating photon cannons with warp technology widely ended in failure.
Skin/Info/BWPhotonCannonForged=Despite their commitment to a rigid warrior code, the Tal'darim have no problem building photon cannons in secret to rain devastation on their enemies' mineral lines. 
Skin/Info/BWPhotonCannonIhanrii=The phase disruptor housing of the Ihan-rii photon cannon features a distinctive wing-shape inspired by a majestic avian creature that once ruled Tyrador IX's skies, at least until it was hunted to extinction by early terran settlers.
Skin/Info/BWPhotonCannonTaldarim=[ph] PhotonCannonTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWPlanetaryFortressCovertOps=The latest planetary fortresses have cannons so powerful that their anchors must be driven three times deeper to prevent them from skidding backward each time they fire.
Skin/Info/BWProbe=Designed by the Khalai to lay the foundation for protoss settlements, probes are self-sufficient drones that can enable and initiate the warp-in of critical prefabricated structures.
Skin/Info/BWProbeBlizzcon17=These probes were salvaged from a destroyed protoss colony by members of a junker gang, who then retrofitted them with terran engines and accessories. If nothing else, their craftsmanship is unique.
Skin/Info/BWProbeGolden=A small number of probes have survived since the period following the Aeon of Strife, where even the simplest of protoss robotics had a refined and luxurious appearance.
Skin/Info/BWProbeIhanrii=When not in use during long periods of deep-space hibernation, Ihan-rii probes fold into perfect cubes for compact storage.
Skin/Info/BWProbePurifier=These probes are models of efficiency and diligence. They operate on enhanced protocols for full integration with the Purifier data web.
Skin/Info/BWProbeRemastered=Probes from the Great War era had longer stabilizer fins, but phase-smiths quickly learned that they could become a liability in the midst of a widescale, vicious battle.
Skin/Info/BWProbeTaldarim=Probes utilized by the Daelaam are calibrated to gather resources with as little ecological impact as possible. The Tal'darim have no use for such precautions.
Skin/Info/BWPylon=Forging a new psionic matrix has been vital to the Daelaam's reconstruction efforts. The khaydarin crystal within each pylon allows the protoss to tap into the matrix's energy.
Skin/Info/BWPylonForged=Each Tal'darim pylon crackles with enough psionic energy to power sixteen gateways.
Skin/Info/BWPylonIhanrii=Across areas of Tyrador IX recolonized by the Ihan-rii, proliferating fields of luminescent pylons produce an ethereal glow visible from orbit.
Skin/Info/BWPylonTaldarim=[ph] PylonTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWPylonXPR=Kor-shakal was once the crown jewel of Aiur, a city so resplendent that it defied description. Even structures as simple as its pylons were adorned in shining decorations.
Skin/Info/BWQueen=To safeguard the future of the Swarm, Kerrigan orchestrated the creation a new breed of queens. Capable of independent thought and analysis, they serve as the hive masters of an ever-evolving Swarm.
Skin/Info/BWQueenMecha=The magnificent queen was the first completed production model to go missing. Loath to publicly reveal their activities, the Simulant Project managers investigated the matter as quietly as possible.
Skin/Info/BWQueenPrimal=Primal packs are ruled by strength alone, therefore queens occupy a much different position within them versus more traditional broods, and are rarely present in great numbers.
Skin/Info/BWQueenRCZ=Queens defend the Cerberus backline with forged titanium blades, jet-powered spine launchers, and matronly instincts even a neurological overhaul couldn't eliminate entirely. 
Skin/Info/BWQueenWebby=Even the queens of the Leviathan Brood are incredibly vicious and hostile. Any creatures foolish enough to approach their clutch with hostile intent find themselves quickly impaled by many spines.
Skin/Info/BWRavager=Evolved from roaches after years of genetic modification, ravagers possess the ability to quickly generate massive quantities of corrosive bile and then expel them at their foes.
Skin/Info/BWRavagerBone=Calcification of zerg carapaces into a hardened shell makes for effective armor. Abathur considers the intimidation factor a welcome bonus.
Skin/Info/BWRavagerMecha=Simulant ravagers have been fitted with heat-absorbent panels instead of spikes around their plasma fire receptacles to prevent damage to the rest of the model. 
Skin/Info/BWRavagerPrimal=Defiant and bloodthirsty, the primal ravagers will devour their own young if they are not strong enough to fight back. Given this level of aggression, it is uncertain how long their species will thrive.
Skin/Info/BWRavagerRCZ=The plasma spines on the Cerberus ravager's back superheat the corrosive bile it fires. On Tyrador IX, these ravagers punched massive holes in the terran defense.
Skin/Info/BWRavagerWebby=Monstrous and towering, the fully evolved ravager is a terrifying sight to behold. The webbed nightmares deployed by the Leviathan Brood are only more so.
Skin/Info/BWRaven=Invaluable for surveillance and defense, the raven can construct a turret, build a defense drone, or fire missiles at enemy forces. If this wasn't enough, it's also more cost effective than its predecessors.
Skin/Info/BWRavenCovertOps=The pride of the Dominion Special Forces, this exquisitely designed craft is rumored to be able to detect Kel-Morian miners whispering to each other two kilometers underground.
Skin/Info/BWRavenJunker=Highly advanced surveillance craft aren't the most popular among mercenaries, but beneath the rust and cracking paint, these ravens are as good as any others in the Dominion.
Skin/Info/BWRavenSilver=As the Cerberus zerg threatened to overwhelm Tyrador IX's defenders, a high-altitude raven detected a fleet of strange stone ships in the planet's gravity well.
Skin/Info/BWRavenUmojan=The height of sophistication, these ravens are equipped with a little-understood artificial intelligence system that exceeds anything that Dominion engineers would ever approve.
Skin/Info/BWReactor=While researching protoss containment fields, terran scientists made a breakthrough that allowed commanders to double their production capacity.
Skin/Info/BWReactorCovertOps=Cutting-edge reactors now rival the energy output of thor engines, with only marginally reduced reliability.
Skin/Info/BWReactorSilver=Presidential suites in Tyrador IX's five-star resorts each come with their own military-grade reactor, in recognition of the complex recreational electronics and cybernetics the wealthiest guests tend to bring along.
Skin/Info/BWReaper=Recruits who prove resistant to resocialization are trained as Reapers. Hyper-aggressive and prone to taking risks, these shock troopers seldom survive a full tour of duty.
Skin/Info/BWReaperCovertOps=In the wake of recent reforms, reapers are no longer forced to use dangerous stimulants to increase their performance. The recruiting process now favors candidates who are naturally unpredictable.
Skin/Info/BWReaperJunker=There's never a shortage of reapers among Mira's Marauders. They tend to outdo themselves scrapping together their distinctive armorâparticularly the mohawks.
Skin/Info/BWReaperSilver=On Tyrador IX, an invasion force of Cerberus zerg was spotted by a reaper taking the long way home to avoid a dust storm near New Canaan.
Skin/Info/BWReaperUmojan=Over the course of many years, the Umojan Protectorate was able to psychologically profile enough suitable candidates to create their own Reaper Corps with surprisingly good results.
Skin/Info/BWRefinery=The refinery is designed to extract raw vespene gas and package it into a handy cylinder, which is easily transportable by space construction vehicles.
Skin/Info/BWRefineryCovertOps=The special forces refinery harvests vespene just as fast as the regulation model, but produces 75% less noise.
Skin/Info/BWRefinerySilver=Despite diligent maintenance, Tyrador IX's refineries have reported lower-than-average vespene yields since the Cerberus attack, as if the underground reservoirs they tap have been diverted.
Skin/Info/BWRoach=Roaches were hand-selected by the Queen of Blades for assimilation into the Swarm. Their impressive tissue regeneration and acidic venom make them resilient as well as deadly.
Skin/Info/BWRoachDeluxe=Under Zagara's orders, Abathur has continued to manipulate the zerg genome in search of perfection. The roach's innate regenerative abilities make it the ideal candidate for such a pursuit.
Skin/Info/BWRoachMecha=These machines have been outfitted with a sophisticated self-repair system to replicate the roach's incredible healing ability, while also combatting structural damage from its acid reserves.
Skin/Info/BWRoachPrimal=Roaches were among the first to be absorbed into primal packs on Zerus, where they developed the capability to mutate into primal igniters and primal guardians.
Skin/Info/BWRoachRCZ=Cerberus scientists bulwarked the roach's already-impressive armor with a carbon fiber nanoweave. Forged titanium blades were added to aid its offensive capabilities as well.
Skin/Info/BWRoachWarren=Generating roaches and ravagers requires humid, dark conditions. The roach warren is a perfectly constructed biological organ that replicates this environment precisely.
Skin/Info/BWRoachWarrenMecha=Significant polymer-alloy innovations were necessary to develop a housing for the Simulant roach warren that would withstand the turmoil of its internal acid generation.
Skin/Info/BWRoachWarrenRCZ=Cerberus adaptations of zerg structures like the roach warren produce self-replicating blueprints for remote control equipment to be installed synchronous with larval development.
Skin/Info/BWRoachWebby=Much like the zantar slugs they are derived from, roaches display an incredible potential for adaptation. Vespene exposure has been known to cause those of Leviathan Brood to grow incredibly aggressive.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsBay=The robotics bay serves as the primary research and development facility of the khalai's foremost phase-smiths.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsBayForged=Terrazine fumes leak from the dark, ominous claw that is the Tal'darim robotics bay.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsBayIhanrii=The segmented assembly arms of the Ihan-rii robotics bay move with flexibility and speed that belie their stone composition.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsFacility=Phase-smiths require expansive facilities to warp in enormous war automatons, such as the colossus.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsFacilityForged=An armored housing and heavy-duty, reinforced anchors give the Tal'darim robotics facility an intimidating profile.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsFacilityIhanrii=The Ihan-rii have been evasive when questioned about the frenzied activity of their newly constructed robotics facilities, which churn out heavily armed units at all hours of the day and night.
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsFacilityTaldarim=[ph] RoboticsFacilityTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWRoboticsSupportBayTaldarim=[ph] RoboticsSupportBayTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWSCV=The T-280 SCV is a staple of construction and repair across all terran worlds. A versatile and reliable workhorse, the Space Construction Vehicle is an invaluable industrial tool.
Skin/Info/BWSCVBlizzcon17=Even junker gangs have to collect minerals and vespene gas, though they try to do so in an intimidating style.
Skin/Info/BWSCVCovertOps=Due to the unique demands of covert missions, even the SCVs must be outfitted with all of the latest upgrades, including a stronger utility clamp and new laser extraction claw.
Skin/Info/BWSCVJunker=Tired of low pay and long hours in the Dominion, some SCV pilots choose to go the mercenary route. It's safe to say that most of them never look back.
Skin/Info/BWSCVRemastered=T-280 SCVs dating back before the Brood War featured a different, less bulky appearance with smaller utility clamps and, purportedly, secret cup holders.
Skin/Info/BWSCVSilver=When selecting armor for their planetary defense force, the Knights of Tyrador chose a platinum-iridium alloy to maximize gleam and scratchproofing.
Skin/Info/BWSCVUmojan=Simple, sturdy, and reliable, these SCVs feature laser drills that make perfectly clean cuts on even the densest minerals.
Skin/Info/BWSensorTower=Using a combination of electromagnetic and thermal technology alongside Doppler analysis and seismic sensors, the multispectrum output of these towers causes them to be easily detectable by enemies.
Skin/Info/BWSensorTowerCovertOps=After a false alarm triggered by an overlarge moth led to the vaporization of a Mar Sara trading post, the new line of sensor towers had its perceptive power dialed back slightly.
Skin/Info/BWSensorTowerSilver=Soon after the Cerberus zerg attacked, Tyrador sensor towers began detecting strange seismic patterns, but these were attributed to widespread Ihan-rii construction efforts.
Skin/Info/BWSentry=Robotic combat drones outfitted with force field generators and holo-projectors, sentries were developed in order to support and protect the dwindling numbers of protoss warriors.
Skin/Info/BWSentryGolden=Sentries themselves have no clear predecessors within protoss robotics, but imaginative phase-smiths have redesigned them to complement other vessels with longer histories.
Skin/Info/BWSentryIhanrii=Long ago, the Ihan-rii protoss harnessed volatile xel'naga artifacts known as "nebula wells" to power their sentries. Few of these artifacts remain.
Skin/Info/BWSentryPurifier=Though Purifier armies often prefer energizers, some sentries are present within their ranks. These drones have been integrated into the Purifier data web rather than relying on psionic energy.
Skin/Info/BWSentryTaldarim=While most sentries seized by the Tal'darim are refitted into havocs, some are left mostly unchanged. This results in a varied array of robotic support and a certain degree of misdirection.
Skin/Info/BWShieldBattery=Shield batteries were largely abandoned in the wake of the Brood War due to advancements in shield regeneration. After improvements were made to its throughput and capacity, some factions reintegrated the technology.
Skin/Info/BWShieldBatteryForged=Though the Tal'darim have access to shield batteries, they typically prefer to invest their resources in more aggressive pursuits.
Skin/Info/BWShieldBatteryIhanrii=To justify their construction of a vast shield battery defense network and a powerful standing army, the Ihan-rii cite "defense against unruly wildlife."
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTank=A modern replacement for the aging Arclite model, Crucio siege tanks are both versatile and heavy hitting. Battlefield commanders swear by them for both offense and defense.
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTankCovertOps=Though the Crucio has long been popular among the Dominion commanders, it was not without room for improvement. Reinforced plating and heftier cannons make this version even more formidable.
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTankJunker=These beastly tanks are so heavily modified that they hardly resemble their original Crucio models. They fare much better than their predecessors when it comes to impromptu demolition matches.
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTankMerc=Terran mercenaries can always find ways to customize their vehicles, whether it's adding speed through engine optimization, versatility in control configurations, or cosmetic changes to intimidate enemies. 
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTankSilver=Dignitaries above a certain rank are greeted upon their arrival in Tyrador with a ten-round salute from a company of spotless platinum-alloy siege tanks. 
Skin/Info/BWSiegeTankUmojan=Umojan Imperio tanks are a recent invention that has already rivaled their Dominion counterparts in early combat testsâwhich was precisely their goal.
Skin/Info/BWSpawningPool=The spawning pool's large chambers have grown to house the genetic mutations for organisms other than the zergling, including a flightless variant of the queen.
Skin/Info/BWSpawningPoolMecha=Polymer-titanium composites allow the Simulant spawning pool to flex and conform to the volatile ooze it contains.
Skin/Info/BWSpawningPoolRCZ=Cybernetic enhancements keep Cerberus spawning pools in temperature and pH ranges considerably more precise than their pure-biological antecedents.
Skin/Info/BWSpineCrawler=Following the Brood War, the swarm generated spine crawlers to better protect itself from ground threats. They are capable of repositioning around the battlefield to gain area control.
Skin/Info/BWSpineCrawlerMecha=A spearpoint terminating in a monomolecular tip allows the Simulant spine crawler to penetrate even the thickest terran armor. 
Skin/Info/BWSpineCrawlerRCZ=Cerberus has tasked thousands of remote-control spine crawlers with expanding the lava tube networks that criss-cross Tyrador IX's crust.
Skin/Info/BWSpire=The towering nests of the mantis screamers formed the basis for the zerg spire. The stalks that form their foundation are made of flexible muscle.
Skin/Info/BWSpireMecha=A reservoir of propellant gases for Simulant mutalisks and corruptors keeps the spire bobbing against its restraint cables.
Skin/Info/BWSpireRCZ=Mutalisks from subterranean Cerberus spires exhibit echolocative hunting behavior absorbed from Tyrador gigabats, previously the planet's scariest cave-dwelling creature.
Skin/Info/BWSporeCrawler=Spore colonies were not enough to prevent the Overmind's elimination. In order to protect their species, zerg evolved their air defense, creating the more flexible spore crawler.
Skin/Info/BWSporeCrawlerMecha=The first terran pilot to discover that the Simulant spore crawler's fake ammunition had been replaced by a nano-facsimile of the real thing was awarded a generous pension and gold-plated replacement legs.
Skin/Info/BWSporeCrawlerRCZ=Cerberus spore crawlers amass in caverns near Tyrador IX's surface like great fields of pulsing, spiny stalagmites.
Skin/Info/BWStalker=Created by the Nerazim, stalkers are machines that are infused with the shadow essences of their warriors. The ability to teleport makes them both swift and unpredictable.
Skin/Info/BWStalkerDeluxe=The Nerazim's stalker technology has benefited from Khalai engineering. The protoss are now experimenting with integrating dragoon chassis reinforcements into the battle strider frame. 
Skin/Info/BWStalkerGolden=Khalai phase-smiths have attempted to recreate Nerazim's stalkers in the elegant style of the ancient Templar. Unfortunately, their results elicited more offense than admiration.
Skin/Info/BWStalkerIhanrii=These stalkers are inscribed with sacred runes meant to safeguard their animated stone armor against the heretic enemies of the Ihan-rii. 
Skin/Info/BWStalkerPurifier=The Purifiers have further refined stalker programming to draw from a complex log of battle interactions, allowing them to perform well even though they are fully automated.
Skin/Info/BWStalkerTaldarim=Not all Tal'darim seek ascension. Those who wish only to sharpen their combat skills and serve their Highlord often choose to become stalkers, in order to better hunt and kill their foes.
Skin/Info/BWStargate=The process of warping in capital ships requires such a vast amount of energy that the excess light emission can be witnessed from vast distances.
Skin/Info/BWStargateForged=The elongated structure of the Tal'darim stargate helps newly summoned ships accelerate out of the bay and directly into battle.
Skin/Info/BWStargateIhanrii=Though the Ihan-rii claim to be satisfied with partial inhabitation of their ancestral homeworld, their stargates have begun to produce interstellar capital ships, which would suggest somewhat more imperial motives.
Skin/Info/BWStargateTaldarim=[ph] StargateTaldarim info
Skin/Info/BWStarport=The Dominion Marine Corps combat handbook makes very clear that air superiority is vital to terran dominance in the Koprulu sector and beyond.Â 
Skin/Info/BWStarportCovertOps=After each mission is complete, the special forces starport carries its crew and cargo into orbit, where it functions as a fully operational space station.
Skin/Info/BWStarportSilver=Proliferating extraplanetary threats have led the Knights of Tyrador to accelerate their starport production schedules, but the Ihan-rii seem to be amassing air units just as quickly.
Skin/Info/BWSupplyDepot=Every CO worth their salt knows the importance of a supply line. Without a depot fully stocked with food and ammo, warfare is simply impossible.
Skin/Info/BWSupplyDepotCovertOps=On hotter planets, this supply depot's supercharged ventilation system makes it a popular spot for off-duty marines to crack open a few cold ones.
Skin/Info/BWSupplyDepotSilver=The unicorn sigil atop each Knights of Tyrador supply depot is hand-polished twice daily, usually by the freshest and lowest-ranking recruits.
Skin/Info/BWSupplyDepotXPR=After the tragic loss of its heir apparent, Angel Shipping is back in business. The company's shipments are guaranteed to arrive on the frontline ahead of schedule and under budget.
Skin/Info/BWSwarmHost=The Swarm excels at proliferation, especially the hideous Swarm Host. By rapidly birthing multitudes of locusts, a single Swarm Host can overwhelm an enemy army.
Skin/Info/BWSwarmHostMecha=Engineers began to fall ill while working on the swarm host mechanics. However, the safety systems did not report a problem, and production continued undisturbedâfatalities aside.
Skin/Info/BWSwarmHostPrimal=These creatures have developed as an offshoot of the primal hosts, who were the progenitors of all swarm hosts. Now, through a surprising twist of fate, the strains have merged once more.
Skin/Info/BWSwarmHostRCZ=The Cerberus swarm host contains an internal microfactory that equips each locust with remote-control headgear.
Skin/Info/BWSwarmHostWebby=The swarm hosts of the Leviathan Brood are uniquely specialized for amphibious assault and bear many genetic advantages that allow them to move quickly through the oceans and assail their prey.
Skin/Info/BWTechLab=Once combat buildings are established, small tech labs are built alongside them to undertake research and development work. Some of this work can be dangerous, but it is seen essential to the war effort.
Skin/Info/BWTechLabCovertOps=The special forces tech lab uses nanotechnology pilfered from the Dominion's protoss allies to maximize energy efficiency and research speed.
Skin/Info/BWTechLabSilver=Knights of Tyrador tech labs feature state-of-the-art climate control systems to maintain peak efficiency through the planet's intense shifts in temperature.
Skin/Info/BWTempest=Tempests are a recent addition to the Golden Armada, and have earned their place as one of the fleetâs most powerful warships. Their volatile disintegration weaponry is a force to be reckoned with.
Skin/Info/BWTempestGolden=After some experimentation, phase-smiths created customized tempests with high-sheen ornamental plating that could withstand the destructive energies of the vessel's kinetic matrix.
Skin/Info/BWTempestIhanrii=The dampening effect of the Ihan-rii tempest's stone surface enhances its ability to focus the incredible power output of its kinetic matrix.
Skin/Info/BWTempestPurifier=This remotely piloted vessel is one of the signature achievements of the Purifier program, and its Cybros manufactured plating is among the most distinctive of its kind.
Skin/Info/BWTempestTaldarim=Occasionally, the Daelaam impress the Tal'darim. The creation of the tempest was one such moment. Upon first seeing them in combat, the Highlord vowed to seize them for the death fleet.
Skin/Info/BWTemplarArchive=The high templar hone their psionic abilities at the templar archives by accessing and studying the memories and experiences of their predecessors.
Skin/Info/BWTemplarArchiveForged=In between battles, Tal'darim warriors ranked highly on the Chain of Ascension can visit the templar archives to relive their most heroic feats.
Skin/Info/BWTemplarArchiveIhanrii=Ihan-rii templar archives contain the civilization's most closely guarded secrets, including religious texts and instructions for the gruesome semi-organic generation of animated stone.
Skin/Info/BWThor=The ultimate expression of terran military might, the Thor is outfitted with enough artillery to take down an army of enemy combatants on its own.
Skin/Info/BWThorCE=Improving on the Thor has become an informal competition amongst Dominion engineers. Top brass is content with allowing this trend to continue, as long as it results in more powerful siege walkers.
Skin/Info/BWThorCovertOps=A signature achievement in recent weapons engineering, the Dominion Special Forces thor boasts innumerable upgrades and the latest in neosteel plating advancements.
Skin/Info/BWThorJunker=Mira's crew has long desired a Thor of their own, but construction challenges routinely set them back. Any day now, they could find a way to assemble one that is fully functional...
Skin/Info/BWThorSilver=Tyrador thors are treated with a plutonium coating that deflects projectiles below a certain energy threshold. They also look great in parades.
Skin/Info/BWThorUmojan=After years of fervent exploration, the Umojan Protectorate has finally come up with its answer to the Dominion's Thor, and its impressiveness is only matched by the number of Umojan symbols it sports.
Skin/Info/BWTwilightCouncil=The twilight council serves as a meeting place for representatives of the Daelaam to discuss the betterment of all protoss.
Skin/Info/BWTwilightCouncilForged=Another stolen Khalai structure, the Tal'darim twilight council's architecture is more intimidating and somber, though the upgrades it bestows are identical.
Skin/Info/BWTwilightCouncilIhanrii=Ihan-rii council elders have found the return to their homeworld, Arakyr, both familiar and unsettling. Much has changed in their long absence, including a decline in air quality and the extinction of several beloved species, both attributable to terran development.
Skin/Info/BWUltralisk=Ultralisks are legendary for their size and strength. Their armored carapaces are nearly impenetrable, and their gargantuan pincers can both crush and eviscerate their enemies with ease.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskCE=Ultralisks are powerful and destructive enough as they are. When infused with the essence of Zerus's primal zerg, however, they become truly unstoppable killing machines.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskCavern=This cavern is filled with dangerous biological deposits infused with high radiation. The chemical reactions created within are used to build the genetic code required for the ultralisk.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskCavernMecha=The Simulant Project ultralisk cavern houses its radioactive innards within a converted battlecruiser engine heatshield.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskCavernRCZ=This ultralisk cavern churns out three sets of gleaming forged-titanium blades every hour, an intimidating purpose only slightly undermined by the fact that--as a Cerberus vice president once wryly observed--the lights above its mouth look like goofy little eyes.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskMecha=Early in the project, it was agreed that the team would never construct a replica of the ultralisk. When chaos later overtook the lab, it became clear that the agreement had been broken...
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskPrimal=Primal ultralisks exhibit a high level of variety in their appearance, with some closely resembling the Swarm ultralisks, and others adapting different features better suited to life on Zerus.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskRCZ=Cerberus sales teams always make sure to show prospective clients the remote-control ultralisk. Their heat-treated titanium blade implants are a beautiful sight to behold.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskRemastered=Early ultralisks were slimmer and more agile than their modern-day counterparts, with swaths of durable muscle and sinew instead of bulky armor.
Skin/Info/BWUltraliskWebby=Few other living creatures can match the sheer might of the ultralisks. Those birthed by the Leviathan Brood are terrifying visages of spines and blades--monsters worthy of legend.
Skin/Info/BWViking=Developed to bolster the Terran Dominion's anti-air forces, the Viking is a modern classic thanks to its two versatile combat modes.
Skin/Info/BWVikingCovertOps=Dominion researchers have added a new set of twin engines to complement the existing design of the viking, while increasing its firepower in both modes.
Skin/Info/BWVikingJunker=Mira's mechanics have given their Vikings a number of special additions, including massive twin engines that produce an impressively intimidating roar when fully revved.
Skin/Info/BWVikingMecha=Under Emperor Valerian's orders, Castillo Industries has developed a breakthrough in Viking technology. Their prototype features a sleeker and more efficient construction.
Skin/Info/BWVikingSilver=At night, the stunning blue thrusters on this viking can be spotted from miles away, reassuring tourists that the Knights of Tyrador are watching over them.
Skin/Info/BWVikingUmojan=After a protracted negotiation, Castillo Industries has agreed to manufacture a new, heavily plated Viking model exclusively for the Umojan Protectorate.
Skin/Info/BWViper=Originally a part of the primal zerg, the vipers' sequences were incorporated into the Swarm by Abathur himself. Now, they serve as a tool to manipulate the battlefield to their master's liking.
Skin/Info/BWViperMecha=As the Simulant Project neared its completion, the directors became increasingly concerned about what they had createdâand at what cost. The project owners stopped answering questions around this point.
Skin/Info/BWViperPrimal=The original viper specimens possess a number of uniquely vicious defenses, making it no surprise that they came to Abathur's attention as prime candidates for further evolution.
Skin/Info/BWViperRCZ=Vipers with hammerhead cranial implants demonstrate dramatic increases in prehensile proboscis precision.
Skin/Info/BWViperWebby=As one of the original zerg broods, Leviathan vipers exhibit more defiler tendencies than the rest of the Swarm. While this has caused many abnormalities to surface, its potent toxins appear to be worth it.
Skin/Info/BWVoidRay=The result of combining Templar and Nerazim technology, void rays are devastating assault ships that demonstrate what is possible when the two factions unite for a common cause.
Skin/Info/BWVoidRayGolden=The latest void rays have combined the classical refinement of ancient Templar construction with the shadowy coloration favored by the Nerazim.
Skin/Info/BWVoidRayIhanrii=On Tyrador IX, a fleet of stone ships with shrieking void-energy beams appeared and blindsided the Cerberus zerg just as they overran New Canaan's defenses. 
Skin/Info/BWVoidRayPurifier=The Purifier void ray is a true feat in engineering, combining the research of three different protoss factions in a single elegant vessel.
Skin/Info/BWVoidRayTaldarim=Bloodshard crystals are not easily collected. When the Tal'darim do not have enough of them to convert a void ray into a destroyer, they make use of the ship's existing armaments without hesitation.
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrism=By acting as a conduit into the psionic matrix, warp prisms function as both mobile troop transport and emergency power source. Though they are fragile, no protoss fleet is complete without them.
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrismGolden=Ancient Templar warp prisms featured a distinctive crystal lattice that would sometimes reflect the neural patterns of the warriors they transport.
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrismIhanrii=Unfurled, the Ihan-rii warp prism evokes a flower that once covered the hillsides of their homeworld, referred to by its current residents as "Tyrador IX."  
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrismNerazim=Daelaam phase-smiths have broken new ground by adapting warp prisms to use Void energy. These variants, known as phase prisms, have already earned great popularity with Nerazim commanders.
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrismPurifier=Purifier warp prisms can automatically transfer an AI personality between different shells if needed, and warp prisms enable this to happen anywhere on the battlefield. 
Skin/Info/BWWarpPrismTaldarim=Arming warp prisms with advanced weaponry is a point of contention among the fleet lords. Some prefer to use them to simply deploy their own warriors onto the battlefield.
Skin/Info/BWWidowMine=Initially developed by Victor Kachinsky, the widow mine has been refined into a surprisingly lethal device that can fire defensive missiles against unsuspecting enemies.
Skin/Info/BWWidowMineCovertOps=Perplexed by occasional misfires in the past, technicians have added more protective plating to the widow mines to better contain accidents and protect against unintended injuries.
Skin/Info/BWWidowMineJunker=After several rounds of heavily destructive experimentation, Mira's mercs redesigned their widow mines to accommodate additional weaponry and explosives.
Skin/Info/BWWidowMineSilver=Despite gory accidents that make the news from time to time, sleek and shiny widow mines remain a common pet in the upper-class households of Tyrador IX.
Skin/Info/BWWidowMineUmojan=Always fond of robotics, the Umojan engineers held an exclusive competition to craft the perfect widow mine and were thrilled to discover that the winner was still a student finishing her degree.
Skin/Info/BWZealot=Peerless warriors on the battlefield, zealots undergo decades of intense training in order to perfect their combat skills. Their signature psi-blades are formed with their own psionic energy.
Skin/Info/BWZealotGolden=Many zealots were quick to follow the high templar in celebrating the protoss' golden age, along with its artistic and cultural achievements. However, the movement has received no official recognition thus far.
Skin/Info/BWZealotIhanrii=Zealots of the Ihan-rii protoss believe the xel'naga will return one day to bless valiant warriors with eternal godhood.
Skin/Info/BWZealotPurifier=Though they do not possess unique personalities, the sentinels are programmed to be noble warriors equal to their zealot brethren.
Skin/Info/BWZealotRemastered=To demonstrate their fearlessness, many zealots went without head armor during the Great War. This practice has since been discontinued.
Skin/Info/BWZealotTaldarim=The lowest ranking links in the Chain of Ascension are also the ones most eager to prove themselves. A zealot of the Tal'darim is a dangerous foe to face.
Skin/Info/BWZealotXPR=Though the Conclave no longer exists, the praetors who served as its military leaders are still loyal to the Daelaam. For as long as the protoss live, they will continue to fight with valor.
Skin/Info/BWZergling=Savage and feral, zerglings are most dangerous when attacking in large groups that are controlled by a larger and more advanced strain of zerg.
Skin/Info/BWZerglingMecha=Though they look and act just like zerglings, the simulants are purely mechanical reproductions that run wholly on electrical power sources, rather than absorbing the DNA of their enemies.
Skin/Info/BWZerglingPrimal=Some of the smaller primal zerglings have been known to resemble their counterparts in the Swarm, even to the point where they possess similar attack capabilities.
Skin/Info/BWZerglingRCZ=Zergling nervous systems are so hyperactive that Cerberus engineers had to affix two antennas to control their movement properly.
Skin/Info/BWZerglingWebby=The reduction of the zergling genome has had unpredictable results. The growths present on Leviathan zerglings are not intentionally evolved, but a byproduct of their extremely simplified DNA.
Skin/Info/BWZerglingXPR=Few zerg have a shorter life expectancy than the zergling. Any mutation that appears to increase that life expectancy is considered worthy of observation and analysis.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brutalize</c><n/><n/>The Brutalisk was created using an aggressive variant strain of the Ultralisk which resembles a cross between a zergling and a hydralisk.  Unlike most zerg, the Brutalisk was not created intentionally by the Swarm.  Instead, it was unnaturally produced by the genetic testing of zerg bioessence through unknown means.  Although capable of evolving from the Ultralisk, few ever survived in doing so due to the incredible biological changes needing to occur. Those that did have become fearsome weapons of war with the ability to produce powerful bile attacks to ward off would be aerial attackers while still maintaining an even more vicious ground attack than the Ultralisk itself.  Brutalisks that were deemed failures have been jettisoned on various worlds, either living off the land without a master or eventually becoming re-captured and experimented on yet again in an endless cycle of enslavement.<n/><n/>While powerful, Brutalisks have a very slow movement rate. Fast-moving units easily dominate Brutalisks by utilizing hit and run tactics. Alternately, powerful weapons such as siege tanks and battlecruisers make short work of Brutalisks from afar.

This âinvisibilityâ has earned the Ghosts a fear-inspired reputation for their mysterious battlefield tactics. Older models of the Ghost Hostile Environment Suit may not be equipped with a personal cloaking device, but they may be retrofitted with them in the field.

Button/Tooltip/BWDataCore=Contains the locations of the remaining Xel'Naga Artifacts. Destroy it before Kerrigan arrives.
Button/Tooltip/BWDeactivateArtifact=Suspends the power of the Artifact. While the Artifact is inactive, its psionic energy will be cloaked, and it will no longer attract Zerg. However, it will slowly lose this energy over time.
Button/Tooltip/BWDeepTunnel=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows Kerrigan to instantly move to another visible location on the map.  Will automatically target the closest Hatchery/Lair/Hive when near death.</c><n/><n/>As Kerrigan began evolving herself from her original infested state, she evolved a common Zerg technique, to quickly burrow underground.  However, the Queen of Blades took this a step further.  Using billions of tiny muscles at a low frequency, the Queen of Blades is able to break up earth, rock, and vegetation allowing her to "swim" through the ground.  Using a psionic aura around her she can almost "run" faster than she could above ground with nothing impeding her.<n/><n/>When wounded, Kerrigan is able to psionically locate the closest Zerg hive and focus only on getting there immediately for healing.  Although the technique can be used to practically any other known locations, Kerrigan prefers to wait until only absolutely necessary to escape combat as it requires extreme concentration and can only be used sparingly.
Button/Tooltip/BWDefensiveMatrix=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a protective shield around a friendly unit for a period of time.</c><n/><n/>Confederate scientists are still working on creating stable, long-term force field generators, but early research has enabled the deployment of a short- lived defensive matrix that can absorb significant punishment.

Button/Tooltip/BWDiamondback=<c val="FFFF8A">Fast moving tank. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Eviscerator Rail Gun</c><n/><n/>The first diamondback prototypes were produced by the Terran Confederacy during the Great War, but never developed beyond that stage.  After the fall of the Confederacy, Omega Squadron retained a few remaining models that were not lost on Tarsonis.  Diamondbacks are fast, high-damage hovertanks. Rail Gun can fire while the Diamondback is moving.
Button/Tooltip/BWDisplacementField=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Allows Kazansky's wraith to evade 20% of incoming attacks while cloaked.</c><n/><n/>A prototype cloaking field developed by Magellan.  By changing the cloaking field frequency sporadically on the wraith, the targeting systems of most incoming projectiles, whether they be computerized or biological, cause an error which radically alters their course, causing up to a 20% "miss" rate.  Extremely expensive to produce, only Kazansky's wraith has been outfitted with such a device, most generals deeming only his life most worth saving from other less experienced pilots.  
Button/Tooltip/BWDisruptorFenix=Purifier Faction<n/>Robotic disruption unit. Can use Purification Nova to deal heavy area damage.
Button/Tooltip/BWDomination=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Zeratul takes control of a targeted unit. Mind Warp lasts until the controlled unit is either destroyed or Zeratul releases it manually.</c><n/><n/>Tapping into the more forbidden knowledge gleaned over by the Nerazim when studying the void, Zeratul is able to mentally force his way into the mind of a lesser being and subvert them to do his will. Dark Archons, the manifestation of the void merged with the Dark Templar, are able to enhance this ability further in order to permanently control the minds of more than one victim at a time, although the effect is taxing psionically even to them.<n/><n/>It has been theorized that absorbing more energy from the merging of other Dark Templar would allow a Dark Archon to become so powerful it could control countless minds at once with little repercussions in doing so.  In essence, the monstrous archon could control an army under its thrall if it so wanted.  This theory has been met with great concern over the Nerazim council and it has been initially suggested to forbid the use of creating more Dark Archons in the future.

These towering husks are former terrans who have undergone extreme mutation from the zerg hyper-evolutionary virus and possess class 5 bio-signatures.  Unlike most infestations, however, Aberrations are an unintentional mutation by the Swarm sometimes appearing in human encampments when creep completely defiles the land.<n/><n/>Some consider these creatures to be the pinnacle of how two species can merge together in a perverse harmony, others consider it a pure abomination.  In either case, the end result in an effective ground assault creature that towers over the battlefield to reach its target in order to smash it to pieces.  Most effective against armored units, Aberrations should usually only be approached by the air.

Button/Tooltip/BWKerrigan=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">A unique Zerg among the Swarm, Kerrigan is the most powerful agent of the Overmind. </c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Razor Talons</c><n/><n/>During the Swarm's invasion of Tarsonis, as the Sons of Korhal withdrew, Lieutenant Kerrigan's task force was left behind. The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss.<n/><n/>Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was succesfully infested, and she adopted the title "Queen of Blades". Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.
Button/Tooltip/BWKerriganChar=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Current leader of the Zerg Swarm.  Kerrigan is rapidly growing to become one of the highest class psionic users known.Â  She commands potent abilities augmenting both her biology and psionics.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Razor Talons | Psi Blast</c><n/><n/>During the Swarm's invasion of Tarsonis, as the Sons of Korhal withdrew, Lieutenant Sarah Kerrigan's task force was betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk and left behind. The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss and, perhaps, against the shackles placed on him by his Xel'naga master so long ago.  Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was successfully infested and reborn, calling herself the "Queen of Blades".  Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Following the Overmind's death on Aiur, Kerrigan was freed from its influence and began a series of manipulations against the Protoss on Shakuras and the Dominion on Korhal, including her old romantic partner, James Raynor, that ultimately crippled all opposition to her and allowed her to regain control of the entire Swarm.  By the time her intentions were made clear, it was too late and Kerrigan became the undisputed leader of the Zerg and supreme power in the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Mysteriously quiet recently, Kerrigan has been evolving the Swarm and herself, unlocking her true psionic potential.  She is poised to grow into a being far greater than the Overmind ever intended -  a being in which few could ever hope to match in power.

Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Subterranean Spines</c><n/><n/>Evolved from the Hydralisk, Lurkers defend Hive clusters and outlying Zerg colonies by burrowing underground and emitting waves of subterranean spines against their enemies. The spines can even be directed downward into open spaces, provided the Lurker is underground. The only weakness of the Lurker is that it is virtually defenseless while above ground.
Button/Tooltip/BWLurkerDen=<c val="ffff8a">Allows Hydralisks to morph into Lurkers.</c><n/><n/>Enables: <c val="#ColorWhite">Lurkers</c><n/><n/>This evolution allows Hydralisks gain the ability to morph into deadly subterranean ambushers known as Lurkers.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psionic Shock</c><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>Maar was the first successful hybrid to be awakened by Samir Duran.  Containing the best essences from Protoss with some Zerg influences, Maar could corrupt or mind control other protoss.  Used as one of Duran's trusted Hybrid generals, Maar began leading other newly awakened Hybrids on a quest to silence the protoss preservers around the sector.  He also ordered the incredible living weapon, Ulrezaj, to accomplish this task as well.<n/><n/>Most disturbing, Maar is able to regenerate at incredible rates, recreating his physical body when killed, by siphoning energy from other preservers he had imprisoned in a stasis field. He could also teleport long distances to avoid being killed.  However, Maar is most vulnerable when relying too heavily on preserver regeneration.  If within mid-regeneration while draining energy, it is possible he can be permanently killed.

By the Great War, Confederate Medics mostly remained at bases to care for wounded soldiers but were sometimes attached to squads/platoons.<n/><n/>Much like the armor worn by Marines and Firebats, the Medics' Light Combat Suit provides protection against small-arms fire, NBC shielding and full life support.

Button/Tooltip/BWMengskHologramBillboard=Holoboard used to broadcast Dominion propaganda.
Button/Tooltip/BWMercCompound=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Experimental arms researcher.  Allows purchase of special upgrades and units.</c><n/><n/>Since the inception of the Confederacy, there has always existed a special black market for mercenaries that make use of experimental weapons and armor that are deemed too dangerous to be made legal, mostly, due to the fact that many soldiers are not experienced enough to handle the modifications.  The Commander, however, is an expert weapons specialist and is well trained to make good use of the modifications.

Button/Tooltip/BWMindControl=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Permanently converts targeted enemy unit to player control.</c><n/><n/>Mind control is a type of psionic power. Protoss Judicators could use their powers to subtly influence the minds of other creatures. Dark Archons, however, through an immense expenditure of energy, are able to project a portion of their psychic essence into another being, gaining control over its actions and access to its memories.
Button/Tooltip/BWMindSiphon=A focused psionic blast that deconstructs the target's matter and transforms it into raw energy for Tosh. Deals up to <d ref="Effect,MindSiphonCreatePersistent,PeriodCount * Effect,MindSiphonDamage,Amount"/> damage.

Button/Tooltip/BWMissileBarrage=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">An auxiliary missile is fired from General Duke's tank, dealing 100 damage to all ground units in a target area.</c><n/><n/>Although already equipped with incredible firepower using his customized Arclite Siege Tank, General Duke has loaded explosive javelin-class missiles that can be fired from rear launch bays against ground targets in an area.  These missiles can be fired while on the move or when sieged, making them a vital resource to use when numerous smaller enemies present a threat.  Care should be used however, as the missiles have no IFF targeting system, and will damage enemies and allies alike.
Button/Tooltip/BWMissilePods=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Missile Pods deal <d ref="Effect,HurricaneMissileDamage,Amount * Effect,HurricaneMissileDamagePersistent,PeriodCount"/> damage to air units in target area.</c><n/><n/>When standard ATA and ATS laser batteries are too slow to get the job done, some Generals order hurricane-class missile pods as a complementary weapon system.  When threatened with a squadron of smaller vessels, unleashing the volley of missiles allows a spread of equal punishment to all.

Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Eredas was a protoss warrior, left wounded in stasis with two others on Aiur after its evacuation. He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase canons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/BWMonlythArtifactForceField=Force Field protecting the Xel'Naga Artifact.

Kerrigan is equipped with a powerful sniper rifle and possesses multiple psionic abilities. </c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Hostile Environment Suit<n/>C-10 Mk. VI Canister Rifle</c><n/><n/>Brought into the Confederate Ghost program as a child, Kerrigan was never given the chance for a normal life. The neural processing treatments that were used to dampen and pacify her latent psychic powers left her a withdrawn and introverted young girl. Forced to murder countless enemies of her Confederate masters, Kerrigan was finally exposed to a series of clandestine experiments conducted by the Confederate Government.<n/><n/>During a raid on a remote Terran outpost, Arcturus Mengsk discovered and rescued Kerrigan from the Confederate scientists. The Confederates had ruined both their lives, and it was a simple matter to convince the young woman to lend her formidable combat skills to his cause. Although Kerrigan is often called upon to be an executioner, she has never fully embraced the darker aspect of her true nature.

Brilliant and cunning in the extreme, the Overmind will stop at nothing to ensure its success.<n/><n/>The Overmind has the deepest respect for the Protoss, whom it believes to be the greatest species it has sought to conquer. The inevitable conflict with the Protoss will be its ultimate test.

Their weapons come from scavenged flamethrowers and have slowly been gaining a permanent place in terran arsenals although most squadrons have yet to see approval for their construction outside of top secret military installations.  The turret's weapon fires a deadly wall of flame that is ideal for holding off large waves of enemy units. The turret also conceals itself beneath the ground when out of combat, luring unsuspecting enemies into its field of fire.

Zeratul is no exception to this fact as he is one of the oldest Nerazim, second only to the great matriarch Raszagal herself, to have witnessed and harbored the infinite knowledge of the void.  Although age has slowed down this great warrior, as Zeratul trains in hand to hand combat he will remaster his abilities to harness the true power of the void once again and unleash it upon his foes.<n/><n/>Few possess a limited number of technologies that are capable of dealing with these warriors.  Even fewer can take on Zeratul himself, save perhaps, the Queen of Blades...

Can be used across vast distances and reach hundreds of worlds when at full power.</c><n/><n/>When the Zerg first invaded civilian colonies, the Terran Confederacy had manufactured a number of portable machines called Psi Emitters which had the uncanny ability to lure Zerg to their signals. The Confederacy had hoped to use the devices to redirect the Zerg movements away from their holdings, but many had already been destroyed or stolen by the Sons of Korhal.  In response, the Confederacy attempted one final effort to halt the Zerg progress by constructing a specialized emitter that could disrupt the Zerg's communications.  This "psi disrupter" was completed during the Zerg's invasion of Tarsonis, but for reasons unknown, the never activated it.  Newly crowned Emperor Mengsk had heard the rumors about the device, and sent teams back to Tarsonis to recover it, but was never able find it and deemed the device lost.  <n/><n/>Upon the invasion of the Koprulu sector by the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Force, a number of research teams were secretly deployed to find anything of value that could be used to overthrow Mengsk and enslave the Zerg.  Upon one such team landing on the ruined former Confederate capital world of Tarsonis, they uncovered what they believed to be a hidden weapons relay.  Lieutenant Samir Duran instead explained the true nature of the device according to rumors he had heard.  Duran was quick to suggest that the Disrupter be destroyed as quickly as possible, citing if the Dominion learned of its location and purpose, it could put the UED's ultimate goal in jeopardy.

Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorLightGrey">unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Plasma metamorphosis</c><n/><n/>In stark contrast to the lumbering Guardian is the tiny Scourge. These blind terrors seek out enemy starships and dive into them. Catalytic agents found within the body of the Scourge cause it to explode like a living plasma bomb when it smashes itself against the hull of a larger vessel.<n/><n/>Large numbers of these creatures can cripple a squad of fighters or even a Battlecruiser. Like the Zergling, the simplistic genetic makeup of the Scourge allows two of them to hatch from a single egg.
Button/Tooltip/BWScout=<c val="ffff8a">Versatile high-speed fighter. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Dual Photon Blasters<n/>Anti-Matter Missiles</c><n/><n/><n/>Although the Protoss regard these powerful fighters as mere scouts, they are easily a match for most other flying vessels.

Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things âby the bookâ. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Dukeâs ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.

Button/Tooltip/BWSpectre=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Alexei Stukov is the Vice-Admiral of the UED fleet and longtime friend of Admiral DuGalle.</c><n/><n/>Stukov grew up on Earth, rising through the ranks of the United Powers League alongside his friend Gerard DuGalle. Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another. Unlike DuGalle however, Stukov spent most of his military career in top-secret research rather than in actual combat, constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare. His views on the subject were considered "unconventional."<n/><n/>The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector changed the UPL's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure. Now serving the United Earth Directorate, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/BWSpectreConsumption=Drains half the life from a friendly biological unit and gives the Spectre 2 energy for each point of life drained.

Button/Tooltip/BWSpiderMine=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Spider Mines pursue enemy units that come in range, and detonate for heavy area damage. Buried Spider Mines can only be seen by enemy <c val="FFE303">Detectors</c>.</c><n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep. Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>In 2499, Jaunt Pictures published the holomovie, Spider Mines IV: Death from Below, about sentient mines that turned against their creators.

He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase canons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/BWVal03QueenOfBlades=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Current leader of the Zerg Swarm.  Kerrigan is rapidly growing to become one of the highest class psionic users known.Â  She commands potent abilities augmenting both her biology and psionics.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Razor Talons | Psi Blast</c><n/><n/>During the Swarm's invasion of Tarsonis, as the Sons of Korhal withdrew, Lieutenant Sarah Kerrigan's task force was betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk and left behind. The Overmind sensed Kerrigan's formidable psychic powers and saw a great weapon against the Protoss and, perhaps, against the shackles placed on him by his Xel'naga master so long ago.  Kerrigan was captured and placed within a chrysalis, to be assimilated into the Swarm. Kerrigan was successfully infested and reborn, calling herself the "Queen of Blades".  Her psychic potential combined with the Zerg hyper-evolutionary virus transformed her into an incredible weapon against the enemies of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Following the Overmind's death on Aiur, Kerrigan was freed from its influence and began a series of manipulations against the Protoss on Shakuras and the Dominion on Korhal, including her old romantic partner, James Raynor, that ultimately crippled all opposition to her and allowed her to regain control of the entire Swarm.  By the time her intentions were made clear, it was too late and Kerrigan became the undisputed leader of the Zerg and supreme power in the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Mysteriously quiet recently, Kerrigan has been evolving the Swarm and herself, unlocking her true psionic potential.  She is poised to grow into a being far greater than the Overmind ever intended -  a being in which few could ever hope to match in power.

This barrier is capable of withstanding energy output of projectiles such as a rifle slug, a hydralisk spine, or even a photon cannon blast.

Care should be used when being surrounded by such creatures as zerglings or zealots.

Traditionally, most space battles took place between large capitol ships and smaller gunships, but Tarsonian technicians found that small, dynamic high-speed fighters could repeatedly deal damage to large ships while still evading most defensive battery attacks.<n/><n/>The CF/A-17 Wraith is the newest of these space superiority fighters, and although normally armed only with air-to-air missiles, newer variants also utilise a belly-mounted burst laser for ground attacks.

After their banishment from Aiur, the dark templar found Shakuras and the temple, and decided to remain there to study it.  The Nerazim calling Shakuras home postulated only the ancient twin crystals, Uraj and Khalis, could properly channel the temple's energies.  The temple's effects may have been able to reach out in space at one time, but age has reduced its total energy output.   <n/><n/>The temple consists of a pyramid-shaped structure with a small floating crystalline top. he temple itself is protected by powerful shields.  Crystals inside are revered by the guardians of the temple. The temple contains mysteries such as a substance with a smell similar to the drug Sundrop.  Compared to the "wild" temples found on many distant worlds, this particular temple on Shakuras has been described as more "structured".

Because of this, Zeratul harbours a deep-seated hatred for the Protoss Conclave and the Judicator caste who were responsible for his wrongful exile.<n/><n/>Zeratul is proud and noble, but is marked by a dark and tragic aura. Although he is secretive and calculating, Zeratul is extremely honorable and would gladly risk everything to defend his long-lost homeworld of Aiur.

However, it may take centuries before novice Nerazim can utilize it properly.<n/><n/>Zeratul is able to gather Void energies to manifest a dark cloud around himself.  While in this state, he is capable of moving swiftly across short distances, passing over chasms or would be predatory foes.

To the helpless victim trapped within, time moves rapidly for a brief moment, but to the outside observer, the unit appears to be slowed down to a near standstill.  This leaves the affected victim helpless to outside forces which can effortlessly pass this cocoon barrier to inflict damage without fear of retaliation.  Some psionically strong-willed creatures, or those in a berserk frenzy, can break free of this prison faster than those less adept.

They were used by the Swarm in war as early as the fall of Aiur.  Leviathans are essentially the zerg's equivalent of a capital ship.They are classified as class-10 zerg flyers and are the largest in terran records, even larger than a mothership,and have been referred to as "moon sized." Leviathans possess interior evolution chambers, can store tens of thousands of zerg strains within their interior chambers, and are capable of deep-space travel and can land on planets. They can operate in temperature conditions of near absolute zero and are capable of traveling through warp space.<n/><n/>Leviathans are typically armed with a daunting array of bio-weapons. Giant, hollow tentacles resembling those of the spine crawler can grab smaller craft or puncture the hulls of larger ships and insert zerg boarding parties. Most leviathans can launch bile swarms at their enemies, and unleash powerful bio-plasmid charges that deal devastating damage to their targets. Furthermore, coccoons birthed within the leviathan are capable of mutating into mutalisks and brood lords.  Leviathans rarely, if ever, travel alone.

Button/Tooltip/BWImpaler=<c val="ffff8a">Long-range anti-armor ambusher. Must burrow to attack. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Slothien</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Piercing Tentacle</c><n/><n/>Evolved from the Hydralisk, Impalers were rapidly created by Abathur as the Sunken Colony strain was nearly removed from the Swarm's genetic pool.  At its heart, the Impaler strain was part of an impaler colony, an ancestor of the sunken colony.  In order to activate this strain, a corresponding Impaler Den must be placed near a hive.<n/><n/>These creatures, like their Lurker cousins, can attack while only underground, but unleash a massive long range tentacle to deal piercing damage against heavily armored ground enemies.  While the evolution will all but be lost in a short time, while the Queen of Blades has access to them, a combination of the two strains usually means instant death for any ground assault force.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Alexi Stukov grew up on Earth and rose through military ranks of the United Earth Directorate alongside his friend and eventual Admiral, Gerard DuGalle.  When the discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector made it back to Earth, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command by DuGalle of an expeditionary force to bring the inhabitants under UED control.  Although successful briefly in overthrowing the standing Terran power of the Dominion and controlling the Zerg via an enslaved infant Overmind, the situation proved too volatile thanks to the manipulations of self-proclaimed queen of the zerg; Sarah Kerrigan.   As the UED tried to retreat back to Earth, the Zerg overtook them, right before DuGalle comitted suicide.<n/><n/>Stukov himself suffered a different fate.  After UED sympathiser Samir Duran, seamingly under Kerrigan's thrall, tricked DuGalle into believing Stukov a traitor and ordered his death, his coffin was ejected into deep space after his own funeral.  Stukov's death, however, was temporary.  Secretly having tracked the UED ship, his recently deceased body was captured by zerg under a renegade Cererate, Kaloth.  Believing Terrans to be the ultimate threat, Kaloth started an experiment in creating infested human leaders, to turn them against their own.  With his body still viable, Stukov was resurrected through a new form of infestation.  One that would leave his mind fully intact while turning him into a formidable bio-weapon.

By using a significant amount of biomass, Kerrigan can evolve her hive creep's cellular structure to allow zerg ground strains to move faster over creep than normal ground due to a collection of microscopic filaments that allow them to 'skate' across creep rather than breaking through it.  It can also be used to nourish zerg structures, larvae, and other strains.
Button/Tooltip/BWK5DropPods=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Delivers enhanced Zerg strains with timed life to the battlefield. Drop-Pods contain <w><d ref="Effect,K5DropPodZerglings,SpawnCount * 5"/> Devouring Ones lasting 5 minutes,</w> <w><d ref="Effect,K5DropPodRoach,SpawnCount * 5"/> Hunter Killers lasting 3 minutes,</w> and <w><d ref="Effect,K5DropPodInitialPlacement1,SpawnCount * 5"/>  Torrasque's lasting 1 minute.</w></c><n/><n/>Zerg Leviathan's, massive class-10 zerg flyers, can not only store many zerg warriors within them but have recently evolved their interior evolution chambers to enhance zerg strains.  Launched from Kerrigan's personal Leviathan, Abathur prepares aging, yet incredibly strong, strains of zerg warriors that the old Zerg Cerebrates created in the Swarm so many years ago.  <n/><n/>Unfortunately the DNA of these creatures is extremely volatile and, as a side effect upon being outside of their spawning pools, are susceptible to severe tissue breakdown, causing these enhanced zerg to only be viable for a short time on the battlefield.  Larger breeds such as the mighty Torrasque strain will break down faster than smaller breeds, but the raw carnage these creatures can cause before this occurs is undeniable.

Unfortunately her true psionic potential became limited by this restrained design.  However, with her thoughts now her own, she has learned to evolve herself to unlock that potential by collecting potent bio-masses and special materials with psionic energy to evolve her own biology.  By constantly improving upon her own being, she can evolve herself into something greater than her simple infested beginnings.  Overtime, Kerrigan will become a creature with almost god-like powers that few will be able to match.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Psionically reaching out to her Leviathan in orbit, the Queen of Blades is able to bend space-time itself in order to quickly summon a variant of her massive beast to her side in battle.  While not as large, the Leviathan brought to her side is no less as much of a threat as its parent.  Historically difficult to control, it takes an extremely powerful psi user to issue commands to the most powerful zerg air borne flyer on record.  Unfortunately the unnatural summoning from Kerrigan's psionics breaks down this Leviathan's tissue at an alarming rate, eventually killing them after a period of time.<n/><n/>Once brought to Kerrigan's side, the Leviathan attacks with four spine crawlers on its underbelly to impale any ground targets it comes across while capable of launching bile swarm projectiles against aerial foes.  When threatened with larger capital ships, the beast is capable of launching bioplasmid globes dealing massive damage and it may even put enemies in a form of biostasis, completely disabling them.  Most unique, and also terrifying, about the Queen of Blades's Leviathan is its ability to self-birth airborne cocoons which are able to spawn mutalisks and even brood lords to defend its mother fro those who would threaten her.

In order to keep her hives thriving, Kerrigan can use massive amounts of biomass to speed up the morphing strain process the larva takes into a drone.  In fact, the speed is so great the larva can use the efficiency to split itself into two drones, instead of one.  This effect is not unlike its ability to do this for zerglings or scourges.  The value of doubling the speed of drone production cannot be understated for an enemy that wipes a colony out is themselves destroyed moments later when the zerg return in full force.

Button/Tooltip/BWKorhalCannon=<c val="ffff8a">Tarsonis' primary defensive weapon.  Can destroy any vessel in or around Tarsonis' orbit.</c><n/><n/>When the Zerg invaded the Confederate capital, many struggled to get to the orbital platform housing the planet's primary defensive weapon; The Ion Cannon.  All remaining Confederate troops stationed on the platform had either been killed or abandoned their post as the Zerg invaded.  No transports from the surface were able to successfully land on the platform.  <n/><n/>As the remaining Confederate forces were being decimated by the Zerg below, Arcturus Mengsk's armada, still orbiting the ravaged planet, managed to secure the platform for itself and reactivate the weapon.  Against recommendations from General Duke, Mengsk ordered the weapon to fire not only on the Zerg in order for them to make their escape back to Korhal, but on his former allies, James Raynor and the Magistrate, should they try to flee from being imprisoned for the crime of mutiny.<n/><n/>Ion cannons fire beams of negatively charged ions, doing heavy damage to armored targets.  Although rarely seen on Terran stations, these weapons can cause tremendous damage at long range, but are incredibly slow to fire.  They are most vulnerable when attacked from nearby on the ground, as they have no natural defenses against short-ranged attacks.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-300/400 Powered Combat Suit<n/>8mm C-14 "Impaler" Gauss Rifle</c><n/><n/>Horace Warfield grew up on Tarsonis as he rose through the ranks of the Confederate military with surprising speed, earning commendations from his superiors for valor, tactical brilliance, and decisive leadership in his squad.  He first saw combat on Sonyan early in the Guild Wars where he quickly made first lieutenant under Arcturus Mengsk where the two became friends.  After the war, Warfield became disenchanted as he carried out Confederate "peacekeeping" duties. When the nuclear destruction of Korhal occurred Warfield immediately deserted the Confederacy. Within a short time, Warfield established contact with the rebel group "The Sons of Korhal".<n/><n/>Warfield's intimate knowledge of the Confederacy's military strength, position, and movements was invaluable to the success of the rebellion.  During the Great War, it is rumored that Warfield's assistance may have led to rebel recovery of the psi-emitter on Mar Sara, and their use on Tarsonis.  As the newly formed Terran Dominion took hold over the Koprulu Sector, Warfield became a general in the Dominion Armed Forces and was seen as one of the more trusted advisors to the new emperor. Mengsk trusted Warfield with his most crucial tasks, strategies, and missions.  Later, during the Brood War, General Edmund Duke referred to Warfield as "the emperor's other brat," insinuating that Warfield was not in Augustgrad when the zerg betrayed the Dominion after the city's reclamation from the UED.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Apocalypse-class laser batteries<n/>Missile Pods</c><n/><n/>The CSF Ragnorak was a Confederate Behemoth-class battlecruiser of the Colonial Fleet, captained by Captain Bolshev.  When the destruction of Tarsonis occurred, Bolshev immediately deserted the Confederate army, took the ship and established contact with the leader of the Sons of Korhal, Arcturus Mengsk.  Bolshev offered his years of Confederate tactical knowledge as well as the Ragnarok itself; Mengsk decided the latter was sufficient enough and had Bolshev executed for "lack of loyalty".<n/><n/>General Warfield was presented with the Ragnarok as a token of his friendship with the new emperor.  Hand-picking the entire crew, Warfield trained each one personally to ensure all were battle hardened and ready at a moments notice.  The Dominion had the massive cruiser retrofitted to include the latest prototypes available.  Unlike the standard Behemoth-class weapon complements, the Ragnarok contains twin cruiser cannons that can make short work of targets as well as deploying side anti-air missile pods for additional support when under heavy aerial combat.  The impressive firing speed of the cruiser cannons has already begun research into applying this into the next Battlecruiser class to improve its effectiveness in battle.

He survived the destruction of Omega Squadron during the zerg invasion of Tarsonis by burning a path of zerg in front of him until he fled the planet with a handful of survivors.  He was soon conscripted and became first sergeant in the Dominion's new Omega Squadron once Mengsk came to power.  Gui met up with his former friend once the Commander was brought in, although against his will, to lead Alpha Squadron.<n/><n/>Gui is highly distrustful of any government, be it the Confederacy or the Dominon.  He is often found first in combat and rarely seen as the last man out.  Taking pride in his custom flamethrower weaponry, the Dominion has taken great notice in seeking new improvements to their firebat armament based on Gui's designs.

Displaying a keen sense of leadership, he quickly rose the ranks from within the Confederacy and was promoted to the title of 'Magistrate' on the colony of Mar Sara.  Soon after taking the position, however, the Zerg invaded and he became increasingly frustrated with the lack of empathy the Confederate government had toward the colonists suffering.<n/><n/>En route to relocating colonists away from ravaged towns, he met a local marshall; James Raynor.  He too shared a disillusion with the Confederacy and together they joined Arcturus Mengsk and the Son's of Korhal to lead a revolution.  However, that alliance came to an end when Mengsk betrayed his own and left his most trusted lieutenant, Sarah Kerrigan, to the Zerg.<n/><n/>The Commander helped Raynor escape from Mengsk and his newly founded Dominion government over the ashes of the Confederacy.  However, the two had a disagreement when Raynor was convinced Kerrigan was being held captive on Char by the Zerg.  Believing Raynor to be blinded by his feeligns, they went their separate ways.  Unfortunately, the Commander was found soon after and arrested for treason.  Instead of a public execution, Mengsk realized his talents should not be wasted and was reinstated as Commander to the Dominion's new Alpha Squadron.

While normal siege tankÃ­s utilize a powerful standard cannon, many siege tank drivers have cited their arclite weapon can be further enhanced for increased blast damage at the cost of safey and eventual explosion of the tank.  The response was the creation of a uniquely powerful custom tank that is able to withstand the kickback to the maximum power of the blast.  However, due to the heavy costs associated with such designs, only elite captains and generals (notably General Edmund Duke) may be allowed to pilot such vehicles.<n/><n/>Periodically, a group of no more than two drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Unknown</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Brutalize</c><n/><n/>The Brutalisk was created using an aggressive variant strain of the Ultralisk which resembles a cross between a zergling and a hydralisk.  Unlike most zerg, the Brutalisk was not created intentionally by the Swarm.  Instead, it was unnaturally produced by the genetic testing of zerg bioessence through unknown means.  Although capable of evolving from the Ultralisk, few ever survived in doing so due to the incredible biological changes needing to occur. Those that did have become fearsome weapons of war with the ability to produce powerful bile attacks to ward off would be aerial attackers while still maintaining an even more vicious ground attack than the Ultralisk itself.  Brutalisks that were deemed failures have been jettisoned on various worlds, either living off the land without a master or eventually becoming re-captured and experimented on yet again in an endless cycle of enslavement.<n/><n/>While powerful, Brutalisks have a very slow movement rate. Fast-moving units easily dominate Brutalisks by utilizing hit and run tactics. Alternately, powerful weapons such as siege tanks and battlecruisers make short work of Brutalisks from afar.

To the contrary, the Defiler uses these genetic matrices to produce cancer-like toxins which have dramatic and deadly effects on the Zerg.<n/><n/>Although it would seem counter-productive for the Zerg to kill their own troops, the catastrophic effects produced by this forced devolution have been known to destroy legions of enemy troops.

These tumors can be forcefully ejected from her body and placed onto an open area to create creep instantly, allowing her to move faster or allow drones to construct new buildings faster.  The noxious gases to produce such an effect can temporarily daze enemies.  It is believed that with further evolution the new queen may be able to generate a burrowing tumor which could adhere to creep and accelerate its growth permanently.

Roaches evolved from the fast-healing zantar slug of Garrxax and in use by 2501, taking part in a battle on Shi. Their ranged acid saliva attack is capable of penetrating neosteel and armor, and violently dissolving flesh on multiple entry points. This saliva is derived from the zantar slug and is expelled with considerable force through the muscles that surround the roach's salivary glands--highly specialized striated ducts that produce a unique enzyme that weaponizes the creature's already corrosive saliva.<n/><n/>Zagara is able to spawn her own unique eggs with small genetic variations.

Can fire in rapid succession for massive damage but drains 20 life per missile launched.</c><n/><n/>Perhaps the most poignant example of Terran arrogance is their ability to disregard all saftey and logic to achieve their goals.  Such is the case for what Schezar has installed aboard his goliath mech.  Using micro-fabricated installers, titan-class missiles can be quickly constructed and launched from the interrior of the goliath's primary power chamber bay.  Each missile requires a location to be targeted first before launch.  Once sent into battle, nothing can stop impact.  <n/><n/>However, these missiles were designed for large warships and not personal mechs.  In order to mass-produce these missiles and send multiple missiles towards the enmy, the goliath must be overcharged.  In doing this, Schezar sacrifices his own defense for superior offense.

Any nearby robotic or craft that has been damaged through its shields and the repair drones will get to work immediately when in close proximity to the Skylord.  However, many Tal'darim agree it is wise not to linger too close to a Skylord as this can be a sign of weakness.  For this failure, they may unleash the interceptors upon the unlucky craft.

If the vessel's shields deplete, the beam is cancelled.</c><n/><n/>While attuning the raw energy brought forth by pylon clusters aboard the super carrier, a concentrated beam of unimaginable devastating power is able to become manifested and directed towards a single intended target to be burned or "purified" as the Protoss often state.  Anything caught in the beam's wake may also become incinerated.<n/><n/>Although the immense energy output is taxing to the vessel's integrity itself, the longer the effect can be maintained the more total damage is done.  Few things can withstand the effects of this weapon for long however.  When highly concentrated beams are fired in unison from low orbit by multiple super carriers, the effects can incinerate entire worlds, extinguishing all life.

She is now capable of conjuring up an incredible amount of psionic energy to decimate all enemies in a very large area in front of her while simultaneously protecting her own zerg from the damage.  To accomplish this feat takes nearly all of the queen's energy as it pushes the limits of her infested design.<n/><n/>While this ability has been extremely rare to be seen used by the Queen of Blades due to its taxing nature on her, those who have seen her do this were quickly obliterated into ash before they could report back.

Focusing void energy upon huge khaydarin crystals, these massive towers can obliterate most lesser non-protected enemies with a single blast.  However its power is also its weakness - for lesser creatures rushing its base can quickly bring the tower down due to the time needed to recharge the crystal.<n/><n/>Historically, these monoliths are self-standing structures built by hand from the Nerazim and powered via underground pylon matrix energy.  However, with the recent Khalai refugees coming into Shakuras, many phase-smiths have begun to study these structures to see if they could be incorporated into more widespread use beyond Shakuras and replicated to be used with nexus warp fields.

Crashes and fatalities were common among new "recruits" as the unwieldy booster proved difficult to control. The hardware was also known to randomly explode due to poor distribution of fuel lines and air intakes, leading them to be banned among the Confederate army.  <n/><n/>Schezar researchers have rediscovered this technology leading to a complete overhaul. A prototype of a flightless, twin-turbine jump pack was created which, in addition to boosting ground movement significantly, is capable of quick bursts of flight allowing effortless ascending and descending through terrain heights.

Certain massive unit types will recover faster.<n/></c><n/>The technology behind flash grenades is far older than the Terran Confederacy but the effects have been effective throughout the years.  The flash grenade (or flashbang grenade) is a type of terran ordnance designed to damage the retinas and/or photo-optic receptors of the target(s). This is achieved by emitting a burst of light in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum.  Not only can this daze anything caught within its effect for a brief moment but detection scanners are briefly rendered offline due to the massive electromagnetic pulse generated.  <n/><n/>Not even polarized visors of CMC armor can protect a terran from its effects.

No normal marine is able to utilize such grenades as the weapon seems to Ã¬borrowÃ® energy from its owner.  Although taxing, the Commander is able to withstand the tissue damage effects more than most but should still be wary when used in the heat of battle.<n/><n/>Afterwards, a new grenade is constructed using advanced micro-construction technology in the housing area of the CommanderÃ­s suit, but will take time between throws.

Next Level: 3<n/><n/>- Zeratul emits a subtle time altering aura that increases the movement and attack speeds of allies by 10%.</c><n/><n/>An ancient Nerazim ability is to use the void to dilate time in such a manner that he/she appears to move faster to others nearby, but in actuality, time is being slowed down ever so slightly.  In this way, the user of this ability is able to move more swiftly within the time dilation than those outside of it. <n/><n/>While regarded as no more than a simple trick for Dark Templar scholars to play on less advanced students, it has nevertheless been seen to be quite useful on the battlefield where a powerful Nerazim, instead of using this ability on himself, can reverse the temporal flow outward to speed up time to his allies, allowing them to arrive more quickly at their locations and land their attacks more quickly against their enemies.  There is a drawback to this, however, as this aura cannot be implemented on the user himself.

When using his powerful warp blades, Zeratul can actually manifest into existence a psionic aura that allows him to strike at all foes around him with lightning precision.  However, Zeratul and Tassadar are not the first protoss to learn the secrets of merging psionics with the void.  The first was Adun.<n/><n/>Adun was a powerful protoss warrior who led the Templar on Aiur shortly before the exile of the Dark Templar. While the Khalai revered him as a hero due to the stories passed on from the Conclave about his heroic efforts in sacrificing himself in order to weed out the dark templar "taint", the truth has been hidden behind lies.  In reality, Adun refused to carry out the Conclaves order of executing the "rogues" on Aiur.  He in fact protected them to the end by creating a shield of psionic and void energies until it caused him to burn out like a star.  Today, Adun's true legend among the Nerazim is passed down through each generation.

This essence can be funneled into energy to restore Zeratul's own shields and heal any wounds suffered.  To achieve such a feat is to open a small rift into the void itself upon each enemies death, something once achieved by Naraza.<n/><n/>Naraza was a female Nerazim who studied the energies of the Void in the early days of the Dark Templar's exile.  She partnered up with a fellow student, and someone far less ambitious, named Theromos. Eventually she convinced him to perform a ritual to open a rift into the void in order to channel energies that would combine the two of them into a powerful dark archon, permanently. He agreed, but was not strong enough to go through with the ritual. Naraza ignored his pleas to stop and, greedy for more power, was consumed by the Void.  This traumatic event made Theromos pledge to only teach others in the use of the Void's power.   Still, many dark templar today continue to test the limits of their power in the void without heed to the dangers.

Button/Tooltip/BWStalkerShakuras=<c val="ffff8a">Ranged attack strider. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite"> Particle Disruptors</c><n/><n/>The fall of Aiur demonstrated to the Dark Templar that more than just stealth and guile were required to defeat the zerg. Hence, the Dark Templar developed the stalker, a war machine inspired by the Khalai dragoon. While dragoons were piloted by crippled protoss warriors, the stalker is controlled by the shadow-essence of a Dark Templar warrior fused into a metal body.  Nerazim who control stalkers undergo this process voluntarily, said process involving a Void-powered ritual which fuses their shadow essence to the machine. This gives them a preternatural degree of control over their new bodies.  <n/><n/>Stalkers draw their psionic power from their host's connection to the Void, and are armed with carapace-mounted particle disruptors adept against both ground and aerial targets. Stalkers have been credited with many fantastic powers since their battlefield dÃ©but. However, only one is witnessed consistently: an ability to instantly teleport, or "blink", from one spot to another.  This ability requires augmentation to a stalker, through the implementation of a device called a Void displacer. When enabled, the displacer grants stalkers the ability to fade and materialize instantly at a different location, affording them an unprecedented degree of mobility, perfect for quick strikes against the enemy.

Mines were deployed during the Guild Wars. One of the most proficient users was Victor Kachinsky, who became a Kel-Morian war hero as a result. Equipping vultures with spider mines became more popular in the late 2490's, especially on border worlds.  A spider mine burrows into the ground when deployed. When a target enters the range of its motion sensors, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>In 2499, Jaunt Pictures published the holomovie, Spider Mines IV: Death from Below, about sentient mines that turned against their creators. It was the last in the series.

The Academy is the primary center of this research.

He has evaded justice time and time again as he ransacked numerous Dominion holdings.  Arcturus Mengsk has begun seeking Schezar out to make an example out of him to other dissidents of his Dominion role.
Button/Tooltip/BWAldaris=<c val="ffff8a">A preeminent Judicator, Aldaris liaises between the Conclave and the leaders of the Templar Caste. </c><n/><n/>Aldaris is a strong believer in the Protoss vision of the New Beginning. He holds the virtues of communal achievement and selfless honour above all things. Charged with watching over Tassadarâs command of the expeditionary force, Aldaris was quick to chastise the younger Protoss for his mistakes. Aldaris has no compunction against branding those who do not conform to Protoss dogma as heretics and traitors.
Button/Tooltip/BWAleksander=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The mighty flagship of the UED Expeditionary Force.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Laser Batteries<n/>Yamato Cannon</c><n/><n/>The DSS Aleksander is a uniquely designed "super-class" battlecruiser and the flagship of the UED Expeditionary Force during their invasion of the Koprulu Sector.  It is currently commanded by Admiral Gerard DuGalle with crewman Malmsteen at the helm. Before their initial strike against the occupying Dominion forces, the Aleksander was at a terran colony where the UED unleashed zerg upon a group of colonists as a means of observing the zerg in action. The Aleksander remained above the battlefield, never firing a shot. Satisfied with the demonstration, DuGalle ordered the ship leave the planet, leaving the colonists to their fate.<n/><n/>The Aleksander employs additional technology not seen in Confederate/Dominion era Behemoth-class battlecruisers.  Beyond employing cleaner fusion reactors to reduce leakage, the flagship uses a hyper-cycle cooldown applied to its laser batteries, allowing rapid firing, albeit with less initial impact damage, to its targets.  There are even rumors of an advanced FTL-based teleportation system that can quickly move the entire vessel a short distance in the blink of an eye.
Button/Tooltip/BWAleksanderSeekerMissile=Deploys a Seeker Missile which activates after <d time="5"/> and pursues the target unit.  Upon impact, the blast stuns any units in a wide area for 5 seconds.
Button/Tooltip/BWArbiter2=<c val="ffff8a">Protoss Arbiter Flagship. Projects a field that cloaks all friendly units in its range. Can also use Stasis Field,Recall, and Vortex. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor Cannon</c><n/><n/>While all Protoss Arbiters are shrouded in mystery and permeated by latent psionic energy, perhaps the most feared and shining example of this is the Danimoth.  Used primarily in high risk missions, the Protoss only deploy this flagship when they wish their forces to get in and out of a situation without a shred of detection.  The massive khaydarin crystals it carries allows it to recharge its temporal systems much faster than standard arbiters.<n/><n/>Capable of bending both space and time, few enemies of the Protoss have ever witnessed the Danimoth in person without being promptly torn asunder by the Conclaves special attack force cloaked nearby.

When threatened with a squadron of smaller vessels, unleashing the volley of missiles allows a spread of equal punishment to all.<n/><n/>The Aleksander is equipped with advanced propulsion systems within its payload of missiles, capable of dealing increased impact and at a greater range.  However, the time to reload missiles becomes greater than standard missile complements.

He has a long history of fighting for Aiur alongside his comrade, Fenix.</c><n/><n/>Only 262 years old, Artanis was appointed to the position of Executor at a young age during the Zerg invasion of Aiur, following the apparent defection of the previous Executor, Tassadar. Artanis fought the Zerg alongside his old comrade, Fenix, and earned the title of Praetor soon after the death of the Overmind.<n/><n/>Artanis harbors a deep respect and admiration for Tassadar. He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.

The queen's brain is encased in an armored skull, and connected to a set of nerve cords that bear resemblance to those possessed by protoss, giving it the ability to guide and nurture a Hive.
Button/Tooltip/BWBirthQueen=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Specialist unit. Can use Ensnare, Spawn Broodling, and Parasite.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Arachnis Brood-Keeper</c><n/><n/>A rapidly aging organism, the older Zerg Queen cannot command a Hive yet still has value within the Swarm. While it cannot produce larvae as their evolved counterparts, they can still spawn numerous other parasitic creatures. The Queen can also attack by expelling a voracious symbiote that rapidly slices its way through opposing forces. Since her lightly armored body leaves her vulnerable to attack, the Queen usually stays near the central hive to watch over maturing Zerg.<n/><n/>There are very few older Queens remaining in the Swarm, much of their DNA being re-constituted into the new Brood Queens.  Kerrigan has ordered Abathur to let their genome continue in the Swarm until the very last Queen has been killed.

Installed onboard a marine combat suit, when health is detected to be near critical levels the suit automatically powers down feigning death.  The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that bring the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the "occasional" miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.

They relay the Overmind's will, commanding their Broods and directing minions in battle.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Original Zerg Strain</c><n/><n/>Cerebrates were descended from the original Zerg parasites of Zerus that existed before the coming of the Xel'Naga, albeit being much larger and endowed with much greater intelligence. Upon their creation by the Overmind, each Cerebrate and the Brood it led was given a specific role which in turn shaped the Cerebrate's personality. Cerebrates also oversaw the evolution of the Swarm.<n/><n/>Cerebrates further expanded the Zerg hierarchy and came to rely on Queens to oversee hive activity and Overlords to relay commands to and directly control the Brood's minions. While the rigid hierarchy ensured efficiency, the permanent death of a Cerebrate could induce a complete reversal. Broods that lost their Cerebrate frequently became uncontrollably destructive. <n/><n/>Externally, Cerebrates appeared as giant, bloated slug-larvae with numerous purple limbs protruding from the sides.

A standard marine would simply use the shield as an extra plate of armor but the Commander can expertly wield it to actually deflect against incoming projectiles quite effectively, shrugging off otherwise deadly attacks.

This "shadow servant" is semi-corporeal and as such cannot fully meld with the shadows as Zeratul can.  In addition its form can rapidly break down along with the limitation of only dealing a partial amount of the physical damage Zeratul normally can, but its value to distract and confuse enemies cannot be understated.

Button/Tooltip/BWConstructScarab=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Constructs an explosive Scarab drone. Reavers cannot attack without Scarabs.</c><n/><n/>Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.

Armed with their potent Warp Blades, the Dark Templar are deadly and relentless foes capable of devastating conventional forces.

Ability can only be used once every <d ref="Abil,DefensiveMatrix,Cost[0].Cooldown.TimeUse"/> seconds.</c><n/><n/>LarsCorp Technologies, a terran arms manufacturer based in the Kel-Morian Combine, has begun preliminary developments on a defensive matrix system for a future class of Dominion battlecruisers.  Upon the theft of the Hyperion, Raynor took the vessel for significant modifications to avoid tracking and improvements to its systems.  In addition, he had this prototype addition installed in order to better weather attacks against the Hyperion's hull.
Button/Tooltip/BWDefensiveMatrix3=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Magellan enhanced ability.  Casts a protective shield around a friendly unit for a period of time.  Costs less energy than standard science vessels.</c><n/><n/>Confederate scientists are still working on creating stable, long-term force field generators, but early research has enabled the deployment of a short- lived defensive matrix that can absorb significant punishment. This energy matrix can be created around any unit within a short range of the Explorer.
Button/Tooltip/BWDefilerMPConsume=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Defiler feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.</c><n/><n/>As the only breed in the Swarm to show tendencies of cannibalism, the Defiler sometimes feeds off of its own species to regain lost energy. While this practice is particularly repulsive to most civilised species in the galaxy, it has proven to be an effective, if unsavoury, tactic.
Button/Tooltip/BWDevourer=Anti-air flyer. Can spray enemies with acid, lowering their defenses.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Can attack air units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWDevourerCocoon=This cocoon contains a Mutalisk as it is morphing into a Devourer.

Can attack air units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Mantis Screamer</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Corrosive Acid</c><n/><n/>Devourers are an evolution of the Mutalisk. More resilient than the Mutalisk, the Devourer and its corrosive acid is the Swarm's answer to the capital ships of the Terran and the Protoss.
Button/Tooltip/BWDevouringOne=<c val="FFFF8A">Rare strain of Zergling. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Core Genus: <c val="#ColorWhite">Zzâgashi Dune-runners</c><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Claws</c><n/><n/>The Devouring One is a specialized Zergling strain, more powerful and resilient than its standard counterpart. Valued by Zerg agents for their increased survivability, a main weakness of ordinary Zerglings.
Button/Tooltip/BWDisableOvercharge=Orders the Hyperion to disable its Overcharge, reducing attack speed and energy regeneration to normal and halts damage per second to itself.
Button/Tooltip/BWDisruptionWeb=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Casts a net of energy on the ground that prevents any unit or structure underneath from attacking.</c><n/><n/>Corsair pilots can focus their psychic energy through the vessel's Neutron Emitter, creating psionic static which disrupts neural impulses and renders computer-directed attacks inaccurate. The web is drawn towards the magnetic resonance found in ores and minerals. This static prevents all ground units and base defenses from attacking while they remain under it.

Button/Tooltip/BWDragonKnight=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful Dragoon-replacement prototype.  Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Historically, crippled veteran Templar could volunteer to continue serving by being transplanted into dragoon exoskeletons.  However, many saw the end times of the Dragoon fast approaching due to a single point of failure.  For it was only within a dedicated shrine on Aiur in which Dragoons could be constructed and warped via Gateway relays.  The purpose of this was more tradition and religion than actual practical use.  <n/><n/>Instead, phase-smith Karax began working on a new replacement Dragoon prototype that could be built directly on the battlefield within Robotics Bay's.  Scattered across random worlds and moons, the first of these prototypes were nicknamed "The Immortal Dragon Knights".   Karax saw a greater purpose to retrofit Dragoon photon cannons to bolster shields rather than be used for offense.  Although their new weaponry could not attack air units, their usefulness now allows them to protect their allies from any who would do them harm.
Button/Tooltip/BWDropship=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Air transport vehicle.</c><n/><n/>Heavily armored Dropships are a vital part of Colonial defense and are fully rated for both atmospheric and deep space flight. The daredevil pilots of these sometimes faulty, unreliable ships are charged with delivering Marine armor and infantry to any hotspot or combat zone. True to its name, the Dropship is capable of extremely rapid deployment. <n/><n/>Early experiments in equipping Dropships with weapons systems were scrapped in favour of greater carrying capacity.
Button/Tooltip/BWDropshipLoad=Loads units into the Dropship's hold.
Button/Tooltip/BWDropshipUnloadAll=Unloads all units.
Button/Tooltip/BWDugalle=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Gerard DuGalle is a highly decorated Admiral in the United Earth Directorate and a lifelong friend of his executive officer, Alexei Stukov.</c><n/><n/>DuGalle has spent most of his life defending Earth from its enemies. By 64 years of age and with countless victories to his credit, he is considered to be the greatest military leader within the UED. DuGalle was unanimously nominated to command the UED expeditionary force, tasked with pacifying the Koprulu sector and removing the alien threat by any means necessary.
Button/Tooltip/BWDuke=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Commanding officer of Alpha Squadron.</c><n/><n/>General Edmund Duke has been a stalwart defender of the Confederacy for over forty years. Motivated by his love of power and control rather than any heartfelt political affiliation, Duke has earned a reputation for running things âby the bookâ. His long years of service with Alpha Squadron have left him with extensive tactical experience, making him one of the greatest military minds in the Terran Sector. <n/><n/>Despite his abilities, Dukeâs ego and insufferable pride often lead to hostile confrontations with those under his command.
Button/Tooltip/BWDuran=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">An anti-Dominion operative. Joined the UED shortly after they arrived in the Koprulu Sector.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">25mm C-10 Canister Rifle<n/>Personal Cloaking Device</c><n/><n/>A mysterious character, Samir Duran leads a small commando squad who call themselves the Confederate Resistance Forces. Claiming to have served in Alpha Squadron before the fall of the Confederacy, Duran is dedicated to his ultimate goal of bringing down Mengsk and his new Terran Dominion.
Button/Tooltip/BWDuranConsume=Duran feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.
Button/Tooltip/BWDuranDevastatingShot=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Unleashes a wave of corrosive acid that decreases the effectiveness of the targets armor, increasing damage to it by 75%.  During its effect, the target is also damaged by 5 per second.  Lasts for 10 seconds.</c><n/><n/>Duran spews a corrosive blast of acid at a targeted enemy unit.  While the initial blast is quite deadly and can melt the armor off infantry and structure's alike, it also breaks down armor briefly, allowing additional attacks to damage the unit before the acid cools off.
Button/Tooltip/BWEMP2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Magellan enhanced ability.  Creates an electromagnetic pulse that drains all energy and shields from units in the targeted area.  Costs less energy than standard science vessels.</c><n/><n/>By generating a massive, short-ranged electromagnetic pulse, the Explorer can disable shields and special electronics on any nearby units. Although the vessel creating the EMP is not affected, any friendly units within the radius of the EMP pulse are subject to its effects.
Button/Tooltip/BWEngineeringBayFlying=Contains upgrades for Terran infantry.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Missile Turrets
Button/Tooltip/BWEnsnare2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Thick mucus that temporarily slows down all units in the target area.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan sprays her victims with a thick mucus that slows down advancing (or retreating) forces. This biological film will eventual dissolve.
Button/Tooltip/BWEredas=<c val="ffff8a">Elite Protoss Templar recovered from Aiur.  Can attack ground units and withstand heavy attacks to shielding.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Phase Disruptor</c><n/><n/>Eredas was a protoss warrior, left wounded in stasis with two others on Aiur after its evacuation. He was the only survivor of three when an extremist group, the Fist of Ulrezaj, attacked the expedition sent to rescue them. <n/><n/>While the shrine on Aiur was destroyed to create new Dragoons, and with the current slowly diminishing in Protoss ranks, the council on Shakuras tasked Khalai engineers to devise a new cybernetic robotic model to place the battered body of Eredas.  They created a powerful new variant of the Dragoon, the Immortal.  While incapable of attacking air units like its Dragoon counterparts, Eredas' new form is able to fire twin phase cannons to make short work of ground targets.  Furthermore, a new experimental shield matrix was installed to withstand powerful impacts to shielding.
Button/Tooltip/BWEthanStewart=<c val="ffff8a">Powerful infested human that has a variety of corrosive abilities.  Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Primary Attack: <c val="#ColorWhite">Corrosive Bolt</c><n/><n/>Ethan Stewart, a wealthy ex-mercenary leader, was the crime lord of Dead Man's Rock, a world seen as too far from the Terran Dominion to attract its attention. When he was human, Stewart had always known what he wanted and pursued it with a single-mindedness of purpose that stunned his allies and devastated his enemies.<n/><n/>That all came to an end when Stewart was captured by the Queen of Blades' zerg and transformed into a "successful" infested terran.  Unlike most other rapid infestation to humans that leaves them mindless husks, Stewart was believed to contain potent abilities and his cocoon was developed personally by Abathur.  However, this was soon discovered to be false as he was wearing a psi-screen, a device to block psionic beings. His mind was damaged by the psi-screen during infestation and could not be healed.  He was left partially mad and fell into infatuation with his new queen.<n/><n/>While Stewart has no psionic abilities, his infested form allows him to produce powerful corrosive abilities against his enemies, many of which were evolved from the now virtually extinct zerg Defiler.  However, Stewart must consume other zerg often to use them efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/BWEthanStewartBurrowed=Infested Terrans do moderate damage.<n/><n/><c val="FFFF8A">Can attack ground units.</c>
Button/Tooltip/BWEvolveEnsnare=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Queen ability. Spray a thick mucus that slows down units. This biological film will eventually dissolve.</c><n/><n/>The Queen vomits forth spores that secrete a sticky mucous, slowing any units that become enmeshed in her gelatinous trap.
Button/Tooltip/BWEvolveSpawnBroodling=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Queen ability. Launches a small glob of spores at an enemy non-robotic ground unit. Instantly splits the unit into two Broodlings which attack nearby enemies.</c><n/><n/>The Queen spawns Broodlings by first infesting her victim with self-replicating spores. Upon maturation, the Broodlings erupt from their host and search for new enemies.
Button/Tooltip/BWExperimentalFlameThrower=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases Gui's attack speed and damage towards organics significantly.</c><n/><n/>Experimental flame thrower was developed by Schezar engineers to channel energy from Khaydarin crystal shards into the flame nozzle.  The results are devastating to all organics regardless of size.
Button/Tooltip/BWExperimentalPlasmaGun2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 15<n/>Iridium Needed: 14<n/><n/>Fires off a powerful blast of energy at a target dealing a base damage of 200 and an additional 250 damage towards structures and mechanical type units.  Will regain a charge every 120 seconds.  Up to 7 charges can be held at once.</c><n/><n/>A prototype combining a low yield yamato gun with zerg bile.  While extremely unstable, the combined result unleashes a concentrated fiery blast of super-heated plasma at the target which has a particular affinity towards melting even the toughest plating.  Point away from face when using.
Button/Tooltip/BWFeedback2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Drains all energy from the target. Deals 1 damage per point of energy.</c><n/><n/>Tassadar can manipulate raw psychic energy to cause damage by turning the energy of a target against itself.
Button/Tooltip/BWFenix=<c val="ffff8a">Praetor of the Protoss Defense Forces and a venerated and honorable warrior, Fenix embodies the very essence of the Protoss and what they stand for. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Psionic Blades</c><n/><n/>Fenix rose up through the Templar ranks alongside his friend Tassadar. He is both cunning and powerful and has fought against the enemies of the Protoss in countless battles. Capable of strong empathy and tremendous rage, Fenix has long been one of Tassadarâs greatest supporters.<n/><n/>Fenix is distrustful of Aldaris and the Judicator caste, and thus relies only upon the honor of his fellow Templar warriors and his own unparalleled skill in the theater of battle.
Button/Tooltip/BWFenixBarrier=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Fenix overloads his Dragoon's shield capacitors, causing 20 health damage to himself, but rapidly regenerates his shields afterwards.  Lasts for 6 seconds.</c><n/><n/>By causing an overload in his shield's matrix weave, Fenix can cause them to rapidly regenerate to full strength.  While the effect takes a toll on Fenix himself, and can only be maintained briefly, it can spell the difference between life and death against certain situations.<n/><n/>A new meaning to "my life for Aiur" has come about from Fenix' demonstration of his loyalty towards his brethren.
Button/Tooltip/BWFenixSOA=Powerful robotic warrior based on the spirit of a mighty Protoss hero.  Created using secretive Purifier technology.
Button/Tooltip/BWFieldResponseTheta=<c val="FFFF8A">Support trooper. Heals nearby biological units using advanced medical equipment. Part of Mengsk's elite mercenary squadron.  Cannot attack.<n/><n/></c>Using more advanced medical technology than their standard Koprulu medic issued equipment, Field Response Theta is a unit of elite medics under the Dominion Armed Forces.  Though their value to heal front line infantry forces has been seen as invaluable, the Dominion has failed to incorporate their technology into the main division of the armed forces, only being used for special ops.<n/><n/>Due to cost concerns, a group of no more than four drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.
Button/Tooltip/BWFirebat2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy close-range infantry. Works well against light units. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit<n/>Plasma-based Perdition Flame Throwers</c><n/><n/>Like standard Marine Infantry, Firebats are typically âculturally challenged personsâ who have been Resocialised. Equipped with powerful, arm-mounted flame throwers, they serve as assault troopers in the various Terran Militias.<n/><n/>Firebat Combat Suits provide additional protection from heat and flame, although they are significantly heavier than standard Marine armour.
Button/Tooltip/BWFirebatUED=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Heavy close-range infantry. Works well against light units. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">CMC-660 Heavy Combat Suit<n/>Plasma-based Epyon Incinerator Cannon</c><n/><n/>The news of aliens running rampant in the Koprulu Sector caused panic on Earth. The fate of the distant colonies mattered little to the UED, but the Zerg and the Protoss were the most dangerous threat the Earth had ever known. An expeditionary fleet was quickly formed with the best soldiers, generals and scientists of the Directorate.<n/><n/>The fleet's first objective was to complete the unification of Humanity by taking control of the Terran colonies. Then, the UED would command as many Zerg as possible through the weak, second Overmind and use them as weapons. The plan included a final step, the pacification of the Protoss, after the Zerg and the Terran were firmly brought under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/BWForge2=Contains weapon and armor upgrades for Protoss ground units and shield upgrades for all Protoss units and structures.<n/><n/><c val="ffff8a">Enables:</c><n/>- Photon Cannons from Probes

Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Interceptors</c><n/><n/>Tassadar exemplifies the growing rift within Protoss society. Born into a new generation that looks ahead to a dynamic future, Tassadar is frustrated by the stoic view that his elders hold of the past. Tassadar feels that the unbending nature of the Protoss and their inability to re-evaluate ancient traditions will be the doom of his race.<n/><n/>Fascinated by the power and mysticism of the renegade Dark Templar caste, Tassadar hopes to find some way to bridge the gap between these exiles and his masters.<n/>
Button/Tooltip/BWGantrithorInterceptor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Constructs Interceptors that automatically attack the Carrier's target. Carriers may not attack without Interceptors.

The Guardian's explosive acid makes it one of the most deadly weapons of the Swarm. Guardians have a thicker armored carapace and are noticeably slower than Mutalisks, and as such they are used primarily to defend the vulnerable Zerg Larvae.

Hallucinations last <d ref="Behavior,HallucinationTimedLife,Duration"/> seconds before they disappear.</c><n/><n/>It is rumoured that some High Templar have learned to create illusionary duplicates of other beings. While these phantasms have no physical substance, they can be used to draw fire away from friendly units or sow confusion amongst enemy forces.
Button/Tooltip/BWHireShockDivision=<c val="FFFF8A">Heavy tank using powerful modified weaponry. Can switch to Siege Mode to provide long-range artillery support. Part of Mengsk's elite mercenary squadron.  Can attack ground units.<n/><n/></c>The Shock Division is an elite siege tank unit of the Terran Dominion Armed Forces.  While normal siege tankÃ­s utilize a powerful standard cannon, many siege tank drivers have cited their arclite weapon can be further enhanced for increased blast damage at the cost of safey and eventual explosion of the tank.  The response was the creation of a uniquely powerful custom tank that is able to withstand the kickback to the maximum power of the blast.  However, due to the heavy costs associated with such designs, only elite captains and generals (notably General Edmund Duke) may be allowed to pilot such vehicles.<n/><n/>Periodically, a group of no more than two drop-pods may be assigned from Dominion orbital command.
Button/Tooltip/BWHunterKiller=<c val="ffff8a">Special Hydralisk strain.

They sometimes serve as bodyguards for important Zerg entities.
Button/Tooltip/BWImplosion2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a localized gravity well that telekinetically crushes a targeted mechanical unit, dealing 150 damage.</c><n/><n/>A powerful demonstration of her psionic superiority, Kerrigan can use the magnetic and gravitational forces around a mechanical unit and literally crush it against its own weight after lifting it from its stationary location. <n/><n/>The Queen of Blades is quite found of finding a wayward Terran Siege Tank or Protoss Dragoon before crushing it into oblivion.
Button/Tooltip/BWIncreaseCarrierCapacity=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum number of Interceptors that a Carrier can produce, store and launch from 4 to 8.</c><n/><n/>This upgrade refits the Carrier with additional fighter bays.

After his time in the Confederate Marine Corps and subsequent life as an outlaw, Raynor spent many years keeping the peace on the colony of Mar Sara. As Confederate enforcements became increasingly harsh, Raynor decided to join up with the Sons of Korhal.<n/><n/>Although he is new to the movement, Raynor has proven himself to be a dynamic leader and he is well liked and respected by the troops under his command. Despite his often sarcastic demeanour, Jim is fiercely loyal to the Sons of Korhal and will put it all on the line without hesitation.

Eventually Vanderspool openly turned against his men. During a confrontation, Raynor shot Vanderspool in the chest.<n/><n/>Raynor and the other surviving members of Heaven's Devils abandoned the military and were charged with manslaughter in absentia. Following the war, they became outlaws, conducting heists across the Koprulu sector. Years later, Raynor came in contact with Myles Hammond, an old family friend and magistrate of the colony of Mar Sara. Being in a position to grant clemency to Raynor and erase his military and criminal records, Hammond offered Raynor a job as Colonial Marshal. Raynor accepted the offer.

All remaining Confederate troops stationed on the platform had either been killed or abandoned their post as the Zerg invaded.  No transports from the surface were able to successfully land on the platform.  <n/><n/>As the remaining Confederate forces were being decimated by the Zerg below, Arcturus Mengsk's armada, still orbiting the ravaged planet, managed to secure the platform for itself and reactivate the weapon.  Against recommendations from General Duke, Mengsk ordered the weapon to fire not only on the Zerg in order for them to make their escape back to Korhal, but on his former allies, James Raynor and the Magistrate, should they try to flee from being imprisoned for the crime of mutiny.<n/><n/>Ion cannons fire beams of negatively charged ions, doing heavy damage to armored targets.  Although rarely seen on Terran stations, these weapons can cause tremendous damage at long range, but are incredibly slow to fire.  They are most vulnerable when attacked from nearby on the ground, as they have no natural defenses against short-ranged attacks.

Installed onboard a marine combat suit, when health is detected to be near critical levels the suit automatically powers down feigning death.  The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that bring the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the "occasional" miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.

As the civil turmoil reached the boiling point on Korhal, the Confederates launched a salvo of Apocalypse-Class nuclear missiles at the inflamed colony. Korhal IV was devastated, leaving Arcturus with only ghosts of the family and life he once knew. He immediately resigned his Prospector commission and vowed to bring down the Confederate government that destroyed his life. Gathering many of the survivors of the Korhal catastrophe, Arcturus founded a militant terrorist group known as the Sons of Korhal to aid him in bringing down the hated Confederates.<n/><n/>In his efforts to undermine Confederate authority, Mengskâs methods and tactics range from harsh to nefarious.

The flash grenade (or flashbang grenade) is a type of terran ordnance designed to damage the retinas and/or photo-optic receptors of the target(s). This is achieved by emitting a burst of light in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum.  Not only can this daze anything caught within its effect for a brief moment but detection scanners are briefly rendered offline due to the massive electromagnetic pulse generated.  <n/><n/>Not even polarized visors of CMC armor can protect a terran from its effects.

Although the Xel'Naga had constructed various temples across multiple worlds before Aiur, this particular temple was different.  While previous temples had specific functions, this structure was inert.  When the Xel'Naga abandoned their experiments with the Protoss and civil war plunged the world into chaos, many tribes took refuge within its inner chambers.  Some claimed to have discovered secret passages that led to vast underground deposits of the sacred crystal known as Khaydarin.  Why the Xel'Naga would need to store huge quantities of the psi-attuned crystal, remains unknown to this day.<n/><n/>The term "temple" is a misnomer, as there is nothing to suggest any form of worship took place in them.

Raszagal herself was captured by Conclave agents and held prisoner where she was treated poorly.  The Conclave ordered the new Templar executor, Adun, to execute Raszagal and other Rogues as they feared their views could create another Aeon of Strife. Adun interrogated Raszagal, but felt her views were reasonable, and couldn't bring himself to execute her. Instead, he hid her and the other Rogues, faking their executions. Adun felt the Conclave would soon learn the truth of his ruse and began teaching them how to hide from the Conclave. Raszagal learned this new power most quickly, but all the Rogues learned faster than even Adun could teach them. Unfortunately, this caused psionic storms to spiral out of control, alerting the Conclave to the deception.<n/><n/>The Conclave decided to banish the wayward Rogues from Aiur forever. The Templar under Adun were sworn to silence as the Rogues were loaded onto an ancient, but functional xel'naga ship. However, Adun's presence prompted the Khalai to attack him.  Fearing the stress of the attacks could spark more uncontrolled psionic storms, Adun took drastic measures to end the combat. The Rogues escaped as Adun protected them with a brilliant array of light and dark energies.  He became consumed by the energy.<n/><n/>Around the Terran year 2000, Raszagal became leader of the Dark Templar tribes on Shakuras. By 2500 and at 1,045 years of age, she was one of the oldest living protoss, and of the Dark Templar.  Raszagal remained one of the few Dark Templar old enough to clearly remember Aiur from before their exile. However, as Raszagal aged, her control over her powers began to slip.

Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Marshall James Raynor had his personal vulture outfitted with micro-processors which can quickly construct a new mine after the old one has been placed.
Button/Tooltip/BWRazorSwarm=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a powerful psionic storm that deals <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormDamage,Amount"/> base damage to units and a bonus <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormDamage,AttributeBonus[Structure]"/> damage to structures periodically over a <d ref="Effect,OmegaStormSearchArea,AreaArray[0].Radius" precision="2"/> radius.</c><n/><n/>Kerrigan can concentrate enough psionic energy to summon a deadly psionic storm in an area that damages everything in its area over a period of time. While resembling a similar ability used from Protoss High Templar, this power has grown far beyond that which they can achieve and can literally break down structures as well as that of individual units.
Button/Tooltip/BWReaverHoldFire=Orders selected reavers to close their scarab launch bay and avoid engaging enemies, unless given a direct command. Units holding fire will flee if attacked.
Button/Tooltip/BWReaverWeaponsFree=Orders selected reavers to fire at will. They will engage enemy units within range.
Button/Tooltip/BWRedAdder=<c val="FFFF8A">Fast moving tank. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Eviscerator Rail Gun</c><n/><n/>The first diamondback prototypes were produced by the Terran Confederacy during the Great War, but never developed beyond that stage.  After the fall of the Confederacy, Omega Squadron retained a few remaining models that were not lost on Tarsonis.  Diamondbacks are fast, high-damage hovertanks. Rail Gun can fire while the Diamondback is moving.<n/><n/>The Red Adder model was originally deployed to Halcyon to defend against mercenary attacks.  It boasts increased durability, speed, and weapon damage.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchAntennae=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the sight and detection range of Overlords.</c><n/><n/>As antennas are capable of vastly increasing the sensory range of an Overlord, many brood leaders are altered in this way.

Button/Tooltip/BWResearchCombatShield=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Commander has a 50% chance to block incoming ranged attacks.  Will not block any melee or spell damage.<n/></c><n/>The LarsCorp Technologies M98 ballistic alloy combat shield is a prototype for a terran personal protective device. The shield is made of 30mm of bonded carbide, shown to increase marine survivability by 25%.<n/><n/>Through the black market, the Commander is able to purchase this prototype in order to defend against incoming attacks.  A standard marine would simply use the shield as an extra plate of armor but the Commander can expertly wield it to actually deflect against incoming projectiles quite effectively, shrugging off otherwise deadly attacks.  However, the shield provides little cover against the claws of a zergling or the blades of a zealot.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchConsume=Defiler ability. Feeds on and kills a friendly Zerg unit, replenishing 50 energy.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchDisruptionWeb=Corsair ability. Creates a net of energy at the target area that prevents all units and structures underneath from attacking.

Button/Tooltip/BWResearchFortifiedBunkerFrame=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the health of bunkers by 100 and cargo space by 1.</c> <n/><n/>Continued research into using neosteel has been focused exclusively on the Terran bunker.  While only available to special ops' teams, specialized frames for bunkers allow them to increase their size without sacrificing durability.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchHiSecTracking=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Missile turrets gain +1 range and a 20% attack speed bonus.<n/></c><n/>Using the latest systems targeting research, the missile turret standard Longbolt weapon ordinance is able to reach distances not previously achieved.  In addition, automated systems allow a faster response time to lock onto an enemy target, improving its firing speed.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchImprovedFlashbangGrenade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 3<n/>Iridium Needed: 3<n/><n/>The Commander's flashbang grenade has its stun duration increased by 2 and area of effect increased by 66%. <n/></c><n/>Advances in both deploying new grenades faster in the field as well as compartmentalizing its components to allow for greater effect have allowed the flashbang grenade to control the battlefield to an impressive effect.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchImprovedHellfireBlast=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 15<n/>Iridium Needed: 14<n/><n/>The Commander's ability Hellfire Blast has its base damaged increased to 200.  Mechanical and Structure targets will take an additional 200 damage. Upgrades the max charges held to 7.<n/></c><n/>Augmenting the Hellfire Blast using a questionable, yet highly effective, overcharge technique has enabled the temperature output to allow the output blast with enough force to melt the hull off most armored units and reinforced structures.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchImprovedPulseGrenade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 8<n/>Iridium Needed: 10<n/><n/>The Commander's ability Pulse Grenade has its base damaged increased to 100.  Biological and Psionic targets will now take an additional 100 damage. Self-damage also increased to 100.<n/></c><n/>Working with several Protoss artifacts found, human scientists have managed to upgrade the Commander's Pulse Grenade by adding several psi matrix fields that explode upon impact, further devastating ground units.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchIonThrusters=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the movement speed of Vultures.</c><n/><n/>Originally designed for inner-atmosphere shuttles, these engines have been modified to provide increased speed for the Vulture Hover Cycle.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchIrradiate=Science Vessel ability. Infects a unit and damages any biological unit within the diseased cloud.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchKhaydarinCore=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of Arbiters by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>By infusing pure Khaydarin crystals into the heart of the shipâs reactor, the Arbiter gains increased energy storage capacity.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchLazarusProtocol=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Palladium Needed: 21<n/>Iridium Needed: 22<n/><n/>Upon receiving near fatal damage, the Commander automatically becomes incapacitated for 20 seconds while recovering health to 100%.  Can only be activated once every 5 minutes.</c><n/><n/>Utilizing the latest in black market special research, brilliant yet paranoid fringe scientists have created what they dub the Lazarus Protocol.  Installed onboard a marine combat suit with liquified rare materials, the protocol detects when health is near critical levels and immediately the suit automatically powers down, feigning death.  The suit then delivers a highly experimental and controversial set of drugs that brings the occupant to near death before rapidly regenerating any tissue damage done thus far.<n/><n/>Dominion scientists are aware of such drugs but have deemed them unsafe for standard marine use due to the occasional miscalculation of drugs used which instead outright kill the marine occupant instead of saving their life.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchLockdown=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Ghost ability. Temporarily disables a targeted mechanical or robotic unit.</c><n/><n/>Designed for the Ghost C-10 Canister Rifle, Lockdown ammo temporarily disables mechanised units caught within their blast.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchMaelstrom=Dark Archon ability. Temporarily disables all biological units in the target area.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchMetasynapticNode=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of Defilers by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>By stimulating the growth of this portion of the Defiler brainstem, this mutation increases the rate at which bio-toxins are secreted.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchNeosteelPlating=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the armor of most structures by 2.</c> <n/><n/>Neosteel is an exceptionally durable material utilized by terrans. Found on every modern mechanical craft such as the plating on Battlecruisers to the lining on Goliaths, neosteel requires catalytic elements to create. The richest source was New Folsom, but the much safer Sara system is used for the same purpose.  <n/><n/>Recent Dominion research into improving neosteel construction processes has leaked onto the black market, allowing the highest bidder to retrofit existing structure frames with improved plating, able to withstand even the strongest of blasts.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchOcularImplants=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases Ghost sight range.</c><n/><n/>In an effort to improve their effectiveness as covert operatives, Ghost agents can undergo radical surgery to replace their eyes with these sight-range enhancing cybernetic devices.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchOpticalFlare=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Medic ability. Permanently blinds a targeted unit, reducing sight range to 1 and removing detection.</c><n/><n/>UED Medics armed with the A-13 Grenade Launcher can fire flash grenades to blind enemy troops.

Button/Tooltip/BWResearchScienceVesselEnergyUpgrade=Increases the maximum energy of Science Vessels by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchSensorArray=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the sight and detection range of Observers.</c><n/><n/>Observers can be outfitted with enhanced scanners that enable this aerial automaton to better gather battlefield intelligence.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchStasis=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Arbiter ability. Projects a field which holds units immobile, preventing them from moving, attacking, being attacked, or using abilities.</c><n/><n/>By manipulating space-time fields, the Arbiter can place units in a state of Stasis. While the affected unit cannot move, it is also unaffected in any way by other units.
Button/Tooltip/BWResearchWraithEnergyUpgrade=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Increases the maximum energy of Wraiths by 50 and starting energy by 12.5.</c><n/><n/>These high-yield uranium reactors permit the Wraith fighter to remain cloaked for longer periods of time.
Button/Tooltip/BWSC1PsiEmitter=<c val="FFFF8A">Classified technology that lures the Zerg to its location.</c><n/><n/>The Transplanar Psionic Waveform Emitter, also known as a psi-emitter, was first constructed by the Terran Confederate Research Division during the first sightings of the Zerg.  Psi emitters are portable machines have the uncanny ability to lure zerg to their signals. Those running the Confederate Ghost Program found that the zerg are attuned to the psychic emanations of ghosts. The emitters broadcast the neural imprint of a ghost, but at a much greater magnitude.  Requiring a ghost or other psychic to be activated, they can reach across worlds, having a maximum range of around 10-25 light years. Numerous psi emitters in the same area appear to amplify the overall effect. Psi-emitters can be attuned to attract particular zerg breeds to a location.<n/><n/>The Terran Confederacy intended to use psi-emitters to lure the zerg into isolated containment areas. Their plan was to use the zerg to put an end to their other rivals and be lauded as heroes for coming in and destroying the zerg.  However, when activated, these emitters brought the entire Swarm to the Koprulu Sector rather than the manageable numbers the Confederacy had hoped for.  One such emitter, present on Mar Sara, was acquired by Sons of Korhal engineer Merdith Jernic. She was captured by the 417th Confederate Marine Platoon, which had been abandoned by the Confederacy, and questioned by its commander, Lieutenant L. Z. Breanne. Breanne was suspicious of Jernic's story of how she acquired the device (claiming the Sons of Korhal brought it to her), and Breanne accused her of activating it. Jernic suggested letting the zerg attack the cities, while the platoon would escape with the Sons of Korhal and the emitter. She claimed the atrocities of the Confederacy forced the rebels to use the device "against further Confederate aggression". The platoon eventually activated the emitter in order to lure the zerg towards their prepared position and away from the major cities long enough for the Sons of Korhal to evacuate the citizens of Mar Sara City. The platoon was wiped out.
Button/Tooltip/BWSOAGravitonBomb1=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 3.  Next Level: 6<n/><n/>- Zeratul emits a subtle time altering aura that increases the movement and attack speeds of allies by 10%.<n/>- Aura effect is 50% increased.</c><n/><n/>An ancient Nerazim ability is to use the void to dilate time in such a manner that he/she appears to move faster to others nearby, but in actuality, time is being slowed down ever so slightly.  In this way, the user of this ability is able to move more swiftly within the time dilation than those outside of it. <n/><n/>While regarded as no more than a simple trick for Dark Templar scholars to play on less advanced students, it has nevertheless been seen to be quite useful on the battlefield where a powerful Nerazim, instead of using this ability on himself, can reverse the temporal flow outward to speed up time to his allies, allowing them to arrive more quickly at their locations and land their attacks more quickly against their enemies.  There is a drawback to this, however, as this aura cannot be implemented on the user himself.

Button/Tooltip/BWSS_TerraTron=
Button/Tooltip/BWSchezarArmor=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Schezar will regenerate his life slowly if he has not recently taken damage.</c><n/><n/>One of the first modifications Schezar bought from fringe world engineers was the proto-Selfix type steel for his goliath mec.  Using nano-technology Schezar's goliath is able to rapidly patch holes and make vehicle repairs periodically, as long as he hasn't taken any attacks to damage the integrity of the goliath recently.  The armor is extremely rare as only one set made it out intact before the plant was destroyed by the Dominion.  It will take decades before similar nano technology can be developed for use in regular combat.
Button/Tooltip/BWScienceVessel2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Elite aerial support unit. Can use standard Science Vessel abilities at a fraction of the energy cost.  Can also rapidly self-repair at will.</c><n/><n/><c val="FFE303">Detector</c><n/><n/>Commodore Magellan is an advanced Dominion cybernetic construct AI stolen from Confederacy designs during the rise of the Terran Dominion.  Magellan was originally intended to become a new form of Terran Adjutant, however Magellan's impressive AI intelligence rendered it invaluable as a top Dominion scientist.  Originally chosen to test pilot a support craft - the TF-620 Nomad classification "Raven", it was instead assigned it's own unique science vessel.<n/><n/>The modified craft can utilize standard Science Vessel abilities but at a fraction of the energy cost due to a unique energy core design.  Furthermore, using nano-welder parts from a TF-620, Magellan can perform a self-hull repair in mid flight using hundreds of tiny robotic bots.  More research is being performed if these nano-welders can produce other helpful abilities and if the "Raven" is a more suitable vessel for such things.
Button/Tooltip/BWScientistUED=As the the government that would become the UED took control of most the Earth, it launched a massive campaign of "racial purification" against those who had developed minor mutations or replaced part of their body with mechanical implants. Millions died, until a high-profile UPL scientist, Doran Routhe, decided to use the expendable prisoners to found colonies beyond the Solar System.<n/><n/>Four supercarriers were sent to a nearby star system, but a computer malfunction deleted the coordinates. The supercarriers flew past their intended destination into outer space. The AI that controlled the supercarriers kept performing analysis on the prisoners' DNA, and realized that a few generations of interbreeding might suffice for the colonists to develop psionic capabilities. Ghosts are the finest example of these human psychics. <n/><n/>After twenty-eight years of warp travel, vital supplies ran low and emergency protocols took over. The supercarriers crash-landed on planets that would be known as Tarsonis, Moria and Umoja - the first Terran colonies.
Button/Tooltip/BWScoutMP=<c val="ffff8a">Recently appointed to Praetor, Artanis is a strong and capable warrior and pilot. Can attack ground and air units.</c><n/><n/>Armament:<n/><c val="#ColorWhite">Dual Photon Blasters<n/>Anti-Matter Missiles</c><n/><n/>Only 262 years old, Artanis was appointed to the position of Executor at a young age during the Zerg invasion of Aiur, following the apparent defection of the previous Executor, Tassadar. Artanis fought the Zerg alongside his old comrade, Fenix, and earned the title of Praetor soon after the death of the Overmind.<n/><n/>Artanis harbors a deep respect and admiration for Tassadar. He hopes to become as great a leader as Tassadar; a path which, although noble, could cause him to forsake his better judgement.
Button/Tooltip/BWSentryGun3=Defensive structure. Remains below ground unless an enemy target is within range.
Button/Tooltip/BWShadowBlade2=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Artifacts Needed: 3.<n/><n/>- Slashes an enemy unit for 500 damage.  Can only target ground units.<n/>- Deals double damage to enemy structures.</c><n/><n/>One of the highest masteries of the warp blade is to channel the essence of the void into the Nerazim's weapon in a single, devastating strike.  Utilizing the skills learned from Tassadar in channeling his own psionic essence, Zeratul enhances this technique by merging the powers of the Nerazim with the powers of the Khalai and unleashes an attack upon a target with such potent energy that not even a mighty Archon could withstand.
Button/Tooltip/BWShieldBatteryNerazim=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">The Shield Battery uses Psi energy to replenish Protoss units' shields quickly.</c><n/><n/>The Shield Battery has a Khaydarin core that absorbs local Psi energy and contains it until it is needed by nearby Protoss warriors. By approaching the battery core, any friendly Protoss warrior or vessel can rapidly recharge its own shield levels. The battery does have a limited capacity, but will recharge itself over time.<n/><n/>Recently, Khalai engineers have worked together with the Nerazim to enhance the effectiveness of batteries by using specially attuned Khaydarin crystals found uniquely on Shakuras.  These crystals coarse with void-based energy, increasing the range at which the battery can restore shields by 33% and the rate at which shields are recharged by 50%.
Button/Tooltip/BWShuttle=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Aerial transport.</c><n/><n/>Protoss Shuttles are used to carry ground forces into the midst of battle. These robotic flyers are heavily armored, but maintain no offensive weaponry. Shuttles are large enough to carry even the massive Reavers within their hulls.
Button/Tooltip/BWShuttleLoad=Loads units into the Shuttle's bay.
Button/Tooltip/BWShuttleUnloadAll=Unloads all units.
Button/Tooltip/BWSpawnBroodling=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Launches spores which instantly kill an enemy non-robotic ground target. Instantly splits the unit into two Broodlings which attack nearby enemies.</c><n/><n/>The Queen launches a small glob of spores at an enemy ground unit. The spores attempt to âfertiliseâ any organic matter that they come in contact with and are capable of eating through the armored shells of Tanks and Goliaths to reach the occupants within. Victims are instantly metabolised and used to feed the growth of a pair of Broodlings, which hatch within moments. This explosive birth is fatal to the hapless host. The Broodlings are small but vicious and will attack any nearby enemies.
Button/Tooltip/BWSpawnNydusCanal=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Summons a new Nydus Canal at any location covered by creep.  Only one new canal can be created per morph, however, friendly ground units can use any Canal to instantly travel to any other within the Nydus Network owned by the player.</c><n/><n/>The precise origin of the Nydus Canal is unknown, and the exact process of its operation is also a mystery. The initial canal entrance is created and then, when a suitable site is found, a sister entrance can be opened. The Canal then enables Zerg ground units to travel from one end to the other at extremely high speed regardless of intervening terrain.<n/><n/>This enables multiple Hatcheries located across a large area to function as one unified nest, with Zerg warriors travelling from one combat zone to another quickly and efficiently.
Button/Tooltip/BWStewartConsume=Stewart feeds off of another Zerg unit, killing it and replenishing 50 energy.
Button/Tooltip/BWStewartSpawnBroodlings=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Enemies damaged by Stewart become infested and will spawn 2 Broodlings with timed life if killed quickly.  No broodlings are created if Stewart kills them in a single attack.</c><n/><n/>Using part of the evolutionary hyper virus, Stewart injects his victims with a modified version of the virus that can incubate broodlings upon the target's demise.  However, the incubation period is extremely short-lived.  If the victim cannot expire before the period is over, the broodlings will never be created.  Conversely, if the unit is killed too quickly, the broodlings will never have a chance to rapidly grow and spawn from its victim's corpse.
Button/Tooltip/BWStukov=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Alexei Stukov is the Vice-Admiral of the UED fleet and longtime friend of Admiral DuGalle.</c><n/><n/>Stukov grew up on Earth, rising through the ranks of the United Powers League alongside his friend Gerard DuGalle. Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another. Unlike DuGalle however, Stukov spent most of his military career in top-secret research rather than in actual combat, constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare. His views on the subject were considered "unconventional."<n/><n/>The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu Sector changed the UPL's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure. Now serving the United Earth Directorate, Stukov was appointed as second-in-command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control.
Button/Tooltip/BWSunkenColony=<c val="ffff8a">Anti-ground defensive structure.

Rooting itself deep into creep via rows of sharp teeth, the colony grows multiple tendrils that it can use to attack any enemies that come within range.  The impaler colony, a creation of the Overmind, was the ancestor of the sunken colony.
Button/Tooltip/BWSupremeInfestation=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Provides a passive bonus for Stewart.  Grants +100 health, +1 armor, +25% health regeneration and +10% movement speed bonus.</c><n/><n/>After finding secret documents belonging to Ethan Stewart's former Terran life, Kerrigan incorporated their details into the hive's neural network.  Izsha stored them and while they mostly detailed information on the events leading up to Jacob Ramsey and the preserver stored within his mind, they also contained detailed health information on Stewart.  This allowed Abathur to further adapt his infestation of Stewart to more successful methods.
Button/Tooltip/BWTassadar2=<c val="ffff8a">A formerly high-ranking Executor in the Protoss armada, Tassadar was stripped of his rank after disobeying orders to annihilate Terrans in the same manner as Zerg. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Tassadar exemplifies the growing rift within Protoss society. Born into a new generation that looks ahead to a dynamic future, Tassadar is frustrated by the stoic view that his elders hold of the past. Tassadar feels that the unbending nature of the Protoss and their inability to re-evaluate ancient traditions will be the doom of his race.<n/><n/>Fascinated by the power and mysticism of the renegade Dark Templar caste, Tassadar hopes to find some way to bridge the gap between these exiles and his masters.
Button/Tooltip/BWTassadarMaelstrom=<c val="#ColorAttackInfo">Creates a containment field that prevents biological units from moving, attacking or using abilities.</c><n/><n/>A Maelstrom is a type of psionic power utilized by those who have achieved mastery over the void.

Blink is an ability mastered by many powerful dark templar including Zeratul and Raszagal.  However, it may take centuries before novice Nerazim can utilize it properly.  As dark templar gain a greater understanding of the Void they are able to convert themselves into cloud based energy to swiftly move across short distances, passing over chasms or would be predatory foes.  Additional mastery of this ability even allows its user to remain phased out of normal reality, bypassing conventional detection of Nerazim cloaking for a short while. The ability is essential as it may spell the difference between life and death in many situations.

The Warbringer itself does not mount any weaponry, but instead houses a micro-manufacturing plant similar to the Protoss Carrier.  <n/><n/>Unique to the Warbringer's arsenal contains an experimental shield core that weaves a much stronger barrier against large explosive attacks as well as being made of a type of plating that uses internal scarab-like robotics to repair internal damage.

This terrifying weapon that uses an intense magnetic field to focus a small nuclear explosion into a cohesive beam of energy. The Cannon requires a huge energy reserve to fire, but its effects are impressive, to say the least.<n/><n/>Terran engineers are currently working overtime to retrofit existing Battlecruisers with Yamato devices, but many older ships are still in service.

However, Zaszâs sniveling nature often disturbs his fellows who find him to be somewhat unstable. Although Zasz is irritating, he is absolutely loyal to the Overmind and the sacred mission of his race.

Button/Tooltip/BWZeratulVoidAiur01=<c val="ffff8a">Praetor of the Dark Templar, Zeratul possesses powerful psionic abilities and is a master of harnessing the void. Can attack ground units.</c><n/><n/>Armament: <c val="#ColorWhite">Master Warp Blade</c><n/><n/>Like all of his dark brethren, Zeratul was banished from the Protoss homeworld long ago for refusing to submit his will to the 'communal glory' of the Khala. Because of this, Zeratul long harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Protoss Conclave and the Judicator caste who were responsible for his wrongful exile.  That all changed when the Zerg came to the Koprulu sector.<n/><n/>Just before Aiur was overrun by the Swarm, Zeratul was lured to Char from the powerful psionic emanations of Kerrigan, generated subconsciously in her chrysalises.  Once realizing the source, Zeratul sought to put an end to the Zerg found there.  Instead, he met the former protoss executor Tassadar, also led by the same psionic calls, as well as the terran Jim Raynor.  Eventually they both overcame each others prejudice, beginning to heal the rifts between the Khalai and the Nerazim.<n/><n/>After the rebirth of Kerrigan, Tassadar distracted her long enough for Zeratul to slay Zasz, cerebrate and leader of the Garm Brood. This created a connection between Zeratul and the Overmind, which enabled Zeratul to discern the Overmind's motives but conversely allowed the Overmind itself to discern the secret location of Aiur and begin its invasion of his homeworld and the genocide of his entire race.  This dark secret of how the Swarm came to invade Aiur with such precision is currently known only to Zeratul and the late Tassadar.  Zeratul is careful not to reveal these thoughts to his brethren, less all of the healing bonds accomplished since the Khalai and Nerazim rejoined at Shakuras would become in jeopardy.  As a result, this secret has created a heavy burden for the dark prelate to carry with him.

Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_3CAE07C2=Meanwhile, Kerrigan continued to hunt down any psionic signatures belonging to laboratories for Duran's Hybrid experiments, but each turned up abandoned.  The Queen of the Zerg feared her old consort was either beginning to relocate his experiments to safer locations, or his Hybrids were already awakening, preparing for an assault when the time was right.  Finally, one of her organic probes picked up a powerful emanation coming from the Terran world of Emoja.  A live Hybrid was there no doubt.  Re-directing her Leviathan, she sent her forces at full force towards the Dominion occupied world.  Although Kerrigan was not looking to begin her true assault on Mengsk, this strike on a Dominion holding would be as good as any for a first strike.

Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_8A5516F9=Nothing can penetrate my carapace!
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_8B780309=Ah the Protoss have gathered raw iridium.  There may be more to find around here.
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_9058B581=And nearby, waking up to a crisp morning breakfast, the former Dominion Alpha Squadron Commander began going over his strategy for liberating the civilians on an outpost near a secret Dominion military outpost on Emoja.  Over the past several years since the fight on Aiur, the Commander and his loyal followers had become freedom fighters, liberating civilians from Dominion or mercenary oppression.  Requiring more resources than he had to pull this plan off, the Commander knew he had to call in a favor to make this work.  And he had one favor he's been saving up for such an occasion.  Time to ante up Jimmy...
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_92AF11D0=Life returned to an uneasy quiet, but for both Zeratul and Kerrigan, things were anything but quiet.  Both the Dark Prelate and Queen of Blades were still consumed with searching for their own answers as to what the Hybrid threat they both encountered were and how the creature known as Duran was able to create them.  Abandoning their kin, they each went on a unique journey to seek out these answers.  Zeratul began his search on the world Zamara had showed him containing a Xel'naga temple - Pegasus.  Zeratul arrived on the world just in time to witness an unusual energy-like creature emerge from the decayed temple and depart into space. The prelate followed it to a gathering of dozens, possibly hundreds, of other energy creatures. The creatures then created a wormhole through which Zeratul cautiously ventured forth...
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_B0084E76=Incredible.  Using this raw palladium I can decrease the time it takes before my suit starts repairing itself!
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_B736BF71=Thisâ¦is it.  Using the last of this raw palladium I can use an ionized force field to generate a personal shield matrix around meâ¦although the effect will only last temporarily and will break down against close ranged strikes.
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_CE36D69A=Powerful Khaydarin crystals...they contain potent psi essence.
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_D1DD663B=The energy...I can feel my power growing...
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_D38C1BCE=Perfectâ¦with enough of this iridium I can improve my rifleâs firing speed.
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_F46B1DBB=My blades are itching for victims...
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_F5F73E3B=There, that should do it.  This extra palladium should improve my combat suit.
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_F896FD68=The last of the raw iridium.  With this, I can create shock bullets to temporarily blind targets!  Iâm coming for you Schezar!
Param/Value/BWlib_9770F675_FF480304=Raw Palladium.  There may be more around here to find.

Weapon/Tip/BWATALaserBattery=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Behemoth-class Battlecruiser's twin-cannon laser batteries work well against both air and ground targets.  These batteries are located across the Battlecruiser's hull and are used primarily for aerial defense and surface bombardment. They are equipped with advanced optics and sensors to deal with fast moving targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWATALaserBatteryHyperion=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Hyperion's multiple laser batteries work well against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWAcidSpew=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Spore Colony is able to fling seeker spores (a corrosive variation of creep) high into the atmosphere, spore colonies can quickly ravage any incoming enemy air force.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWArbiterMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Phase disruptors launch bolts of anti-particles through a psychically charged field.  These weapons fire antimatter bolts sheathed in a psychically charged field.<n/><n/>Arbiters employ a modified variant of the Phase Disruptor in order to fend off incoming attacks.  However, the weapon's field output is hindered by its temporal systems. As such, its overall power is reduced when compared to Dragoons or Photon Cannons.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWArcliteShockCannon=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The experimental 120mm Mjolnir Artillery Cannon fires plasma shells in contrast to the standard explosives of the Shock Cannon. Effective in "scorched earth" operations. <n/><n/>Like the standard Arclite tank, Duke's command vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated targeting system, able to identify heat sources and their range.
Weapon/Tip/BWArmageddonCannons=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The super-class Aleksander's twin-cannon Armageddon cannons work well against both air and ground targets.  These batteries are located across the Aleksander's hull and are used primarily for aerial defense and surface bombardment. They are equipped with advanced optics and sensors to deal with fast moving targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWBacklashRockets=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Backlash rocket is a type of stinger missile used as a form of air-to-ground ordnance. The rocket's high explosive warhead is lined with plasteel, and is designed to burn through the heaviest neosteel plating known to humanity. <n/><n/>The shoddy guidance systems in these munitions, coupled with massive collateral damage in urban settings, have earned the Banshee an infamous reputation as a Dominion terror weapon.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWBattleCruiserLoki=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When enemies are attempting to close in on the Aleksander, it deploys its powerful twin-laser Serpentis batteries, which can deliver a quick end to short-ranged targets, both air and ground alike.  These batteries are located on the front hull of the massive flagship where they can easily be fired for short ranged targets.
Weapon/Tip/BWC10CanisterRifle=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The C-10 is a canister rifle issued to ghosts.  A relatively obscure weapon at the time, the C-10 quickly became standard deployment to Ghosts by 2491.<n/><n/>The C-10 mainly fires 25mm high explosive rounds.  This version was also equipped with a special underslung low frequency targeting laser that was used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their target with pinpoint accuracy. It was also capable of using a variety of special munitions, including lockdown rounds that temporarily disabled mechanized units caught within the blast.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWClaws=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Zerglings possess sickle limbs and sharp incisor teeth, used primarily for tearing into flesh.<n/><n/>Further mutations may be made to zergling DNA, namely the mutation of their adrenal glands, changing their glandular balance to induce a battle frenzy.  These adrenal glands have been observed to be unusually large for a creature of the zergling's size.  Further analysis has revealed evidence of genetic manipulation, which also increased zergling aggression, driving them into a state of frenzy. In such a state, zerglings can bring down armored vehicles and structures with ease.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWDanimothWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Phase disruptors launch bolts of anti-particles through a psychically charged field.  These weapons fire antimatter bolts sheathed in a psychically charged field.<n/><n/>Arbiters employ a modified variant of the Phase Disruptor in order to fend off incoming attacks.  However, the weapon's field output is hindered by its temporal systems. As such, its overall power is reduced when compared to Dragoons or Photon Cannons.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWDevourer=
Weapon/Tip/BWDevourerMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">From their tail, a Devourer is able to spit a venom of corrosive acid at aerial targets that can eat through the reinforced armor plating of terran and protoss capital ships.  The initial damage these globs inflict is not insignificant, but as spores build up on targets, they will eat through hull plating on the molecular level, making it easier for other attacks to penetrate ship armor.<n/><n/>The acid spores in the venom may hinder the fighting ability of the target, such as reducing an enemy ship's time to reload weapons and will reveal cloaked units.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWDiamondback=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Eviscerator rail guns were originally developed by the Terran Confederacy for their diamondback tanks. They are lightweight, easy to operate, and able to be fired by diamondbacks while they move.  Railguns have a particular knack for burning through reinforced plating, making them ideal tank hunters.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWDragoon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot forces by launching bolts of antiparticles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWFirebat=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Perdition was the standard issue weapon of Koprulu Sector firebats by the late 2490's.  The combusto-plasma fuel is stored in containment fields but pose an explosive hazard if the fields are breached violently.  The plasma fuel easily seeps between gaps in zerg armor; smaller strains are literally cooked alive in their own skin.<n/><n/>Firebats are careful about utilizing perdition flamethrowers and only do so when all squad members in the firing radius has fully functioning CMC Powered Combat Suits, as the backfire can lead to catching allies on fire.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWFusionCutter=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">SCVs are known to be outfitted with various feedback modules to help improve pilot feedback and performance. <n/><n/>One such module is the onboard force feedback module (or OFFM, referred to as OFF ME), which allows the SCV pilot to move the SCV arms and generate a force proportional to the motions of the pilot, allowing for greater range of movement and greater combat effectiveness against close range attackers such as zerglings using their onboard fusion cutters, normally used to harvest minerals.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGantrithorInterceptorLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The maneuverable, computer-guided Interceptors tear through enemy flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower targets with potent plasma-charges. Manufactured and serviced inside of the Carrier bays, a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGhost=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The C-10 is a canister rifle issued to ghosts.  A relatively obscure weapon at the time, the C-10 quickly became standard deployment to Ghosts by 2491.<n/><n/>The C-10 mainly fires 25mm high explosive rounds.  This version was also equipped with a special underslung low frequency targeting laser that was used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their target with pinpoint accuracy. It was also capable of using a variety of special munitions, including lockdown rounds that temporarily disabled mechanized units caught within the blast.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGoliathA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Goliath features a computer-based heavy weapons system.  It's standard anti-air armament consists of Hellfire-AA scatter missiles.  As such, Goliaths are primarily used against aerial targets.<n/><n/>Goliaths were further upgraded with the arrival of the United Earth Directorate in the Koprulu Sector. With improved propulsion technologies via Charon Boosters and upgrades to existing targeting system software, the goliath's range via its Hellfire missiles was increased dramatically.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGoliathG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Goliath has anti-armor 30mm smoothbore autocannons attached in both arms as its primary armament against ground targets. The autocannons fire explosive shells that can pierce the armor of most ground targets.  <n/><n/>As such, while goliaths are primarily used against aerial targets, they still pose a great threat to infantry.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGuardian=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Guardian attacks by lobbing explosive gobs of acid which have a much longer range than the Mutaliskâs spray. This acid can only be directed at targets on the ground below. <n/><n/>Guardians have no natural defenses against aerial opponents.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGuardianMPWeapon=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The Guardian attacks by lobbing explosive gobs of acid which have a much longer range than the Mutaliskâs spray. This acid can only be directed at targets on the ground below. <n/><n/>Guardians have no natural defenses against aerial opponents.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWGuassRifle=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Marines' standard-issue C-14 Impaler Gauss Rifle fires 8mm metal âspikesâ at hypersonic speeds. The rounds are designed to provide maximum penetration against all armor types. To preserve both ammo usage and minimise power requirements, the rifle uses a capacitor system to fire in short, controlled bursts.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWHaloRockets=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">HALO cluster rockets are fired in volleys, using a targeting system to scatter the rockets for a large area of effect. The dispersal radius of the targeting system is designed to achieve maximum damage to not only its intended target, but also adjacent targets within the blast area.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWHighTemplarWeapon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Some powerful Protoss are capable of sending out a short range, quick burst of psionic energy, damaging a nearby target.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWHydralisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Hydralisks strike from a distance with volleys of armor-piercing spines, up to 30cm in length.  Hundreds of these spines are stored in the upper carapace plates and covered by flaps.<n/><n/>The hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a terran's 629, and a portion of these may be used to launch the spines with enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters or even half a kilometer at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle, moving at near hypersonic speeds. The spines were evolved from the slothien's defensive urticating hairs; they may also be "grooved" for increased range.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWInfernalFlameThrower=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The infernal flamethrower projects a burst of ignited plasma fuel, which is deadly against lightly armored targets. Two shielded tanks in the central area of the hellion hold the volatile mixture, and offer an adequate supply of fuel for skirmishes. <n/><n/>However, the unreliability of the ignition system meant hellion drivers would only have to use a lighter, or even a cigarette, to ignite the weapon. This led to the development of a better fuel mix and the infernal pre-igniter, which won't go out even in poor weather conditions.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWInterceptorLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The maneuverable, computer-guided Interceptors tear through enemy flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower targets with potent plasma-charges. Manufactured and serviced inside of the Carrier bays, a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWKaiserBlades=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as "kaiser blades", these scythes are nearly indestructible.  <n/><n/>Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease, able to slice through armored vehicle and eviscerate entire squads of light infantry in just a few swipes.  The density, bevel, and edges of these organic weapons are honed at the genetic level.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWLanzerTorpedoes=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The MT50 lanzer torpedo is an air-to-air weapon used by the Viking, with developments in retrofitting illegal variants of Goliaths with the deadly weapon. Their armor-piercing warheads are particuarly effective against capital ships, but their impact on lighter vessels is diminished.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWLongboltMissile=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Using the relatively inexpensive Longbolt weaponry, a Missile Turret is equipped with an effective anti-air armament.  It's targeting system may be set to computer controlled in order to automatically engage aerial targets without the need for a human controller.  <n/><n/>Due to this feature, it is quite common to see entire rows of unmanned Missile Turrets outfitted on low-orbit blockades around planets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMarine=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Marines' standard-issue C-14 Impaler Gauss Rifle fires 8mm metal âspikesâ at hypersonic speeds. The rounds are designed to provide maximum penetration against all armor types. To preserve both ammo usage and minimise power requirements, the rifle uses a capacitor system to fire in short, controlled bursts.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskDiamondback=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Eviscerator rail guns were originally developed by the Terran Confederacy for their diamondback tanks. They are lightweight, easy to operate, and able to be fired by diamondbacks while they move.  Railguns have a particular knack for burning through reinforced plating, making them ideal tank hunters.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskFirebat=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Gui's custom made flamethrower nearly doubles the legal output of standard Dominion firebat's perdition flamethrowers.  Officers have been told to "look the other way" when inspecting his equipment.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskSiegeTank=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to the AAV-5 Arclite weaponry, the Shock Division's mobile armament consists of twin 90mm PPG-7 plasma cannons that, while not nearly as destructive as its sieged shock cannon counterpart, can still render targets to ash when the need for mobility arises.<n/><n/>With the slightly increased barrel size, total damge is actually decreased when compared to standard Arclites.  However, the speed at which the cannons can reload more than makes up for this.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskSiegeTankSieged=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to the AAV-5 Arclite "Shock Cannon", this model increases the barrel width allowing it to achieve feats in which standard tanks cannot.  While its total damage output may be less than its Arclite counterparts, the speed at which it can reload its payload more than makes up for it.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskWraithA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The primary weapon of the Kazansky's Wraith.  Similar in design to current generation Wraiths, the Mark II missiles unleashes a double payload from dual chambers on each attack, making short work of any enemy craft.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMengskWraithG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Tom's custom designed Wraith uses a similar variant of the CF/A-17 Wraith's 25mm burst laser as air-to-ground armament. However, Magellan helped to increase piercing damage by utilizing dual laser chambers in a single blast.  This has caught many marines unprepared for the heavy assault this wraith can deal to ground forces.  <n/><n/>It is rumored that this model has gained interest in the Dominion for new ways to handle civilian unrest from air to ground forces.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWMutalisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">The mutalisk spawns small, voracious creatures called "glaive wurms", and projects these creatures to attack. Glaive wurms fly between multiple targets as they degrade explosively.  The mutalisk's reproductive system--its ovipositor--has been adapted into a weapon delivery system.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWNeedleClaws=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Small but sharp claws are used by the Broodling when grown rapidly from globs of spores launched from nearby Queens.  Upon hatching these vicious creatures will attack any nearby enemies until either they or the broodlings are destroyed.  Their effectiveness is primarily compromised, however, by their very limited lifespans</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWNeedleSpines=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Hydralisks strike from a distance with volleys of armor-piercing spines, up to 30cm in length.  Hundreds of these spines are stored in the upper carapace plates and covered by flaps.<n/><n/>The hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a terran's 629, and a portion of these may be used to launch the spines with enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters or even half a kilometer at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle, moving at near hypersonic speeds. The spines were evolved from the slothien's defensive urticating hairs; they may also be "grooved" for increased range.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWNeedleSpines2=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Drones are usually single-minded about their tasks, diligently working through even raging combat.  However, in a pinch, the drone's pincers can be used to fend off minor threats to the hive.  <n/><n/>The pincers are a minor evolution of those possessed by larvae, which gives them the ability to clamp and transport objects. The osseous tissue hardens through the pupation cycle, and its density allows drones to cut mineral crystals with ease, or defend themselves when threatened.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWNeutronFlare=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Neutron flares are a protoss technology developed by the Nerazim for their Corsairs, using neutron emitters to fire bursts of energy. They are used in ship-to-ship combat, and can take attack light aircraft in a small area around their target. Neutron flares can also channel psionic static, creating a disruption web that affects ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWNova=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The latest version of the C-10 rifle issued to Ghost agents, the Mark VI can be used both as an automatic weapon and as an anti-personnel sniper rifle. Kerrigan generally prefers the latter.<n/><n/>The Mk. VI is also equipped with a flashlight, can fire EMP rounds, and has retained the low frequency targeting laser that is used to guide tactical nuclear missiles to their intended destination. The accuracy of Ghosts has improved thanks to the Mk. VI containing a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWParticleBeam=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Particle beams are miniature energy projectors used by protoss probes.  They have been in use since the Protoss Empire first began. While particle beams are commonly used to collect samples and mineral crystals, the beam can be boosted to cause kinetic damage to targets deemed a threat.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWParticleDisruptors=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Dragoons provide essential supporting fire for the Zealot forces by launching bolts of antiparticles sheathed in a psychically charged field. These disintegration bolts are effective against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPerditionTurretFlamethrower=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Perdition was the standard issue weapon of Koprulu Sector firebats by the late 2490's. The combusto-plasma fuel is stored in containment fields but pose an explosive hazard if the fields are breached violently.  The plasma fuel easily seeps between gaps in zerg armor; smaller strains are literally cooked alive in their own skin.<n/><n/>As less and less firebat-class soldiers have been reporting to duty, scavenged flamethrowers were used for automated Perdition turret defenses</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPhaseDisruptors=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPhaseDisruptors3=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPhaseDisruptors32=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Similar to standard Dragoon phase disruptors, the Immortal's primary weapon fires antimatter bolts. However, in order to achieve a significant damage improvement, the Immortal has been outfitted with dual phase disruptors that can fire their antimatter bolts sheathed in pure energy. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents immortals from engaging aerial targets.  <n/><n/>With complements of standard Dragoons still a viable anti-air option for the weary Protoss armada on Aiur, there doesn't appear to be a need to develop a new exoskeleton model for this need...yet.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPhotonCannon=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Cannon fires an encapsulated antimatter sphere similar to that generated by the Dragoon. It is an effective weapon against both air and ground targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPredator=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">Robotic research has previously used insects and animals in their model designs but none has achieved great success like the Predator.  By closing in the distance to its targets, this mechanical beast's claws can rip apart almost anything with great ease.  <n/><n/>Furthermore, top-secret research into Protoss energy grids have led to a new addition whereby a discharged deadly field of electricity is released each time it attacks.  How the robotic claw is able to achieve this amount of energy output without exploding is still ongoing in Dominion research.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPsiDischarge=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Some powerful high templars are capable of sending out a short range, quick burst of psionic energy, damaging a nearby target.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPsionicShockwave=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The psionic shockwave is a psionic power possessed by Archons. Using their rage and will, they are able to direct their own energy as a weapon. The powerful blasts produced rip organic tissue apart, causing massive damage through rapid cellular degeneration and the transfer of thermal energy. <n/><n/>While psionic shockwaves are most effective against biological targets, even heavy plating yields before their might.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWPunisherGrenades=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The Quad K12 "Punisher" grenade launcher is mounted on each arm, each of which can deploy hundreds of grenades. The K-12 was originally designed to crack hardened-zerg carapaces, but its payload are able to decimate structures and armor as well.<n/><n/>A fully automated weapon system, the K12 can deliver armor-piercing Punisher grenades to large or small ground targets. The weapon's autoloader assembly also boasts a miniature manufacturing plant that replenishes the suit's ammunition stores while in the field, allowing the marauder to fight through drawn out engagements without the need to resupply. Energy for the manufacturing process is supplied by an auxiliary power generator mounted on the back of the marauder's 5-4 Armored Infantry Suit.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWQueenOfBladesPsiBlast=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Kerrigan is able to summon a small amount of pure psionic energy and launch it at a ranged target.  Although not as efficient as her melee claws, this psionic blast is Kerrigan's only method of combating aerial targets or to attack ground targets from a distance until they are close enough for her deadly claws.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWRaynorSpiderMines=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When a target enters the motion sensor range of a burried spider-mine, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Groups of mines can share sensor data making it difficult to traverse a spider mine field undetected.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWRazorTalons=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Kerrigan is capable of eviscerating her targets with extremely sharp and durable claws extending from her hands.  She is also quite fond of using her long wing-like talons protruding from her back to impale her victims or to pry open the hulls of ground robotics or vehicles.<n/><n/>Kerrigan's numerous razor-sharp attacks have inspired her to create a nickname for her new form - "Queen of Blades".  The nickname has already spread fear among the Dominion and Raynor's Raiders, both of whom fought her on Char when she first emerged from her chrysalis.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWReaverScarabsLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWScourge=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Catalytic agents within the scourge allow it to undergo a form of plasma metamorphosis, causing it to explode like a living bomb. A single scourge is capable of destroying a terran starfighter or shuttle and a handful can breach the hull of a starship.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWScoutAir=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Antimatter missiles are a protoss technology and the primary anti-air armament of the scout. They are outfitted with an antimatter payload. They are designed to destroy heavier aerial targets, allowing the scout to serve as a fleet escort.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWScoutGround=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Blaster is a protoss technology and anti-ground armament for the scout. They are used for light harassment, when scouts are called upon for ground operations. Scouts are outfitted with two of them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWScoutMPAir=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Antimatter missiles are a protoss technology and the primary anti-air armament of the scout. They are outfitted with an antimatter payload. They are designed to destroy heavier aerial targets, allowing the scout to serve as a fleet escort.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWScoutMPGround=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The Photon Blaster is a protoss technology and anti-ground armament for the scout. They are used for light harassment, when scouts are called upon for ground operations. Scouts are outfitted with two of them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWSiegeBreaker=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When mobile, Duke's armament consists of twin 90mm PPG-7 plasma cannons.  These weapons are notably stronger than standard mobile Arclite weaponry.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWSiegeTank=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">AAV-5 Arclite weaponry was renowned throughout the Confederacy for its heavy firepower and stalwart emplacement/advance tactics.  It's primary attack, a 120mm "shock cannon", was originally designed to be a static "final defense" weapon against insurrection from the Guild Wars.  However, the conflict demonstrated the need for mobility and as a result an effort was made to make the cannon more mobile.<n/><n/>When mobile, Arclite armament consists of twin 80mm PPG-7 plasma cannons that, while not nearly as destructive as its sieged shock cannnon counterpart, can still render targets to ash when the need for mobility arises.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWSiegeTankSieged=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">AAV-5 Arclite weaponry was renowned throughout the Confederacy for its heavy firepower and stalwart emplacement/advance tactics.  When sieged the previously mobile twin 80mm PPG-7 plasma cannons are rapidly converted into the 120mm Shock Cannon.  This weapon had been worked on even before the "dual-mode" Arclite model was created and was designed to be a static "final defense" cannon against insurrection from the Guild Wars.<n/><n/>Capable of decimating entire squadrons in seconds, the shock cannon is both feared and respected throughout any military organization that uses them.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWSuicide2=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Infested terrans can explode, sacrificing themselves in a splash of toxic fluid. The resulting explosion has a ten meter radius, a large shockwave and can destroy small structures.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWTychusChaingun=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGR-14 was used to train Confederate Marine Corps recruits and old models existed as far back as 2478. The Commander's rirfle has been used throughout his military career and has been modified to increase damage and firing speed than typical models.  The rifle is highly modifiable to allow it to achieve devestating results.<n/><n/>The AGR-14 fires at supersonic speeds and makes a very intimidating roar when it does so. It is capable of firing jacketless slugs that can tear through with great effectiveness both standard organics up to the reinforced plating of a tank.  With the right components it can even fire small ultrasonic pulses to briefly daze victims.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWTychusCommandoChaingun=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGR-28 was only manufactured in very small amounts before it was deemed illegal by the Confederate government.  As such, its one of the most valued gauss type rifle across all of the Dominion.  The weapon, while deadly in its own right, can fire armor piercing rounds that can breach the hulls of nearly any mechanical armor type.<n/><n/>A grenade launcher can be attached in secondary fire mode to clear the way against infantry incursions.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWUltralisk=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as "kaiser blades", these scythes are nearly indestructible.  <n/><n/>Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease, able to slice through armored vehicle and eviscerate entire squads of light infantry in just a few swipes.  The density, bevel, and edges of these organic weapons are honed at the genetic level.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWVulture=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The AGP-2 "Thumper" grenade launcher is the primary armament of the Vulture hover cycle.  These grenades are simple, yet elegant terran anti-personnel weapons that are designed to disperse shrapnel upon exploding.  These weapons, however, are ill-advised to use against reinforced hull or structure plating.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWVultureSpiderMines=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">When a target enters the motion sensor range of a burried spider-mine, it digs itself out and moves above ground to the target and detonates.  Groups of mines can share sensor data making it difficult to traverse a spider mine field undetected.  Terran infantry traditionally distrust the mine's IFF.<n/><n/>Spider mines were developed on Earth, and are one of the few technologies to survive the Long Sleep.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWWarbringerScarabsLaunch=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Reavers house and construct tiny robotic drones called Scarabs. The Scarabs are launched in groups at enemy targets or installations. Unlike the Interceptors found on Protoss Carriers, the Scarabs do not return to the Reaver after they attack. Instead, they explode on impact, generating devastating electromagnetic fields that cause heavy damage to their targets.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWWarpBlades=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">The origins of the warp blade lie on the Xel'Naga ship the Nerazim departed Aiur in. Gaining access to new knowledge, the Nerazim used the psi-blade as a template to forge an instrument with which to shape their burgeoning psionic ability, and infuse it with Void energy.<n/><n/>Warp blades react to the user's strength of will, turning centuries of discipline and training into a powerful weapon. Further iterations on its design yielded scythe-like blades, which helped diversify the combat style of the Dark Templar.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWWraithA=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The primary weapon of the Wraith.  In addition to burst air to ground lasers, the standard CF/A-17G Wraith has equipped Gemini-class "air to air" missiles.  Most effective against other vessels, a squadron can bring down slower targets such as the massive Battlecruisers or even Protoss capital ships.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWWraithG=<c val="#ColorTerranLabel">The new G variant of the CF/A-17 Wraith model introduced a belly-mounted 25mm burst laser as air-to-ground armament. Its design was spurred by the lack of an effective terran air-to-ground fighter below battlecruiser weight.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWZealot=<c val="#ColorProtossLabel">Zealots are armed with psionic blades channelled through the forearm units of their power suits.  The Khalai's refinement of the focussers in these units allow the psi-blades to increase in power as a zealot's rage increases in battle.  The blades can tear through armored structures and vehicles with ease.<n/><n/>The zealots' mastery of their emotions mean they can fight longer, harder, and better than their adversaries. A handful of zealots can easily control an entire colony of lesser species.</c>
Weapon/Tip/BWZergling=<c val="#ColorZergLabel">Zerglings possess sickle limbs and sharp incisor teeth, used primarily for tearing into flesh.<n/><n/>Further mutations may be made to zergling DNA, namely the mutation of their adrenal glands, changing their glandular balance to induce a battle frenzy.  These adrenal glands have been observed to be unusually large for a creature of the zergling's size.  Further analysis has revealed evidence of genetic manipulation, which also increased zergling aggression, driving them into a state of frenzy. In such a state, zerglings can bring down armored vehicles and structures with ease.</c>
