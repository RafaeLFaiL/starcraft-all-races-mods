Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00005=Holy ground, huh? We'll keep her safe.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00006=Gonna need an army for that. We'll get out there when we can.

Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00008=Command center going up over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00009=We're taking a licking! Heading back!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00010=Where are you? We're dying out here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00011=We need backup, pronto!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00012=Now would be a great time for reinforcements.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00013=There's something moving out here! We need detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00014=Think I'll get back to running this show.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00015=Alright, I'm taking back control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00016=Can't hurt to take a look.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00017=We've scoped out this area. Scout's heading back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00018=Once I've trained up some soldiers we'll head out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00019=Can't reach that location, partner.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00020=Little busy here. I'll send something out in a minute.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00021=Dammit, they killed my SCV. I'm sending out another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00022=Detection on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00023=Taking this raven back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00024=Building a raven now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00025=The raven's down. I'll send another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00026=We're going to take that expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00044=We must retreat!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00052=Our scout is unable to reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00053=Our scout has been destroyed! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00061=Our enemy is Protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00062=We have encountered enemy terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00063=Hostile zerg have shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00096=We're taking this expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00097=Hive cluster implanted.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00098=Our drones cannot reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00099=A terran building...
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00100=Plant it, raiders.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00101=My boys are training right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00102=You can count on us.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00103=Heading out, and playing it cool.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00104=Encountering some tough resistance.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00105=My guys are headed back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00118=Not happenin'.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00161=Let them come.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00180=We require additional warriors.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00181=Our forces will assault this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00185=We will require additional troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00186=I am resuming control.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00187=We have lost the enemy. Detection is required.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00188=We require reinforcement.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00189=Quickly, send aid! The battle can still be won!
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00190=The khala will guide my hand.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00191=We are exploring this area.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00192=We have sent forth a scout.
Conversation/AICommunication/ARCLine00194=Scouting mission completed.

Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00004=New Record!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00005=Welcome, Commander.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00006=Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum damage on the enemy with the limited forces at your disposal.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00007=The special abilities of your units will be key to achieving a high score. Use them wisely.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00008=Enemy forces are invulnerable until you indicate you are ready to begin by pressing the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00009=You must destroy as many enemies as possible with the creatures available. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00010=Scout the opposing base and when you are ready to begin your assault press the ready button.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00011=Time is short! Attack without mercy and inflict maximum damage!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00012=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior must learn to fight enemies as numerous as the stars in the sky.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00013=In this simulation, you will command a small force resisting waves of attackers. Slay as many as you can.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00014=Use terrain on the battlefield to your advantage. Fight only where your superior warcraft will even the odds.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00015=En Taro Tassadar, student. A protoss warrior understands the strengths of their own forces, and the weaknesses of the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00016=In this simulation, you will use a limited force to defend three pylons from attack.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00017=The pylons are some distance apart, you will need to divide your forces to protect all three.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00018=Study the opposing force and deploy your units so that they will most effectively counter the enemy.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00019=Once you have deployed your forces, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00020=Take heed, attempting to leave the deployment area will invoke punishment.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00021=These three spires are under threat. You must defend them with the forces available.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00022=The spires are widely separated. You must divide your forces to protect them all.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00023=Study your foes carefully. Deploy your minions to best counter each group of enemies.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00024=When you are fully prepared, press the ready button to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00025=Be warned! Attempts to leave the deployment zone will not be tolerated!
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00026=Greetings, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to use limited forces to defend three supply depots.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00027=The supply depots are widely spaced. You will need to split up your forces to create a guard detail for each one.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00028=You should attempt to form groups that will effectively counter the enemy units deployed against them.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00029=When you have completed your deployment, press the ready button to proceed.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00030=Warning!  You are leaving the deployment zone.  Arena turrets activated.  
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00031=Good afternoon, Commander. In this exercise, you must defend all of your structures against a variety of enemy attacks.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00032=You will not have the ability to train additional combat units.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00033=In order to succeed, you will need to use your SCVs to repair your structures and to fight back against the aggressors.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00034=En Taro Tassadar, student. In this simulation, you will learn to control large forces more efficiently.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00035=Begin by organizing your forces into control groups. Examine the units available to you and distribute them into powerful attack groups.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00036=As you can see, you have units stationed throughout the simulation area. These are in stasis until you are ready to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00037=Round 1
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00038=Welcome back, Commander. A strong economy is key to victory, and the key to a strong economy is efficient resource gathering.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00039=In this exercise your base management skills will be challenged. Begin by collecting sufficient resources to expand to the extra resource area nearby. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00040=By building a second command center at the expansion site, you will effectively double the amount of resources you receive.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00041=Complete the exercise by training a force before the time runs out.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00042=Good morning, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to survive through several waves of attackers.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00043=Each wave will be challenging to overcome with the forces available. Directly controlling the actions of your units will give you the edge you need to prevail.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00044=Press the ready button when you wish to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00045=Welcome, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum possible damage using only the siege tanks and medivac dropships allocated.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00046=You will have a limited amount of time to destroy as much of the enemy base as possible. Scouting the base with your medivacs before making your assault is advised.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00047=Enemy forces cannot be harmed until you press the ready button, so conduct your scouting carefully.
Conversation/Challengescombined/ARCLine00048=Once you are ready, strike swiftly! Destroy as many enemies as possible before time runs out!

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCGroup00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00008=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00024=It was Tassadar who kept the templar from extinction that day.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00086=Raynor revived his campaign against the Dominion...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00096=...and ruled the Swarm once again... only this time... free.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00098=She learned that Raynor was still alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00099=Despite encountering his best troops,  and traps, she personally ended his life.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/ARCLine00100=Amon's plans were still unfolding.

Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00049=Should we call tech support?
Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00050=I jiggled the cable, but nothing happened.
Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00051=Everything about this is gross.
Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00052=Ew, it's like they're trying to communicate.
Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00053=I don't know... Reboot it again!
Conversation/MechGunner/ARCLine00054=My cyclone's under zerg control!

VoiceOver/Cyclone/ARCPissed03=Gonna just keep poking me anyway, huh? Look, can we get back to fighting? I'm actually good at that!
VoiceOver/Cyclone/ARCPissed04=How about I make this real simple. You point them out, then I risk my neck by driving right up to them... then, get this, I kill them. Sound good?

VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCPissed05=Adun, Tassadar, Zeratul... All of my mentors met an early end. Perhaps the cost of greatness is too high?
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCPissed06=Have you ever said my name backwards? There is a strange music to it...
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCReady00=We must stand as one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat00=Dawn will come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat01=We shall prevail.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat02=Our destiny awaits.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat03=Strength in unity.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat04=Harhak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat05=Change is upon us.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCWhat06=I serve my people.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes00=A bold plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes01=Our path is clear.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes02=There can be no doubt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes03=Together, we are strong.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes04=With honor, I lead.
VoiceOver/ArtanisVoid/ARCYes05=The future is ours.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack00=Grovel, you worm!
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack01=Your agony begins.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack02=By blood and fury.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack03=Unmitigated chaos.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack04=I shall ascend.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack05=Thus I conquer.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCAttack06=Woe to the slain.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCDeath00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCDeath01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCDeath02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCHelp00=You dare to challenge me?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed00=We are bound by the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed01=But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed02=My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed03=You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed04=Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed05=If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed06=What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed07=And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCPissed08=Ow. I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCReady00=Vengeance for the betrayed.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat00=Ask. I may listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat01=Action is the only course.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat02=May the terrazine flow...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat03=The talons of Slayn listen.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat04=Remember your place.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat05=Alakor nir shazak.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCWhat06=I heed, because Alarak wills it.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes00=Acceptable.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes01=As the chain commands.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes02=Ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes03=Na adan korikas.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes04=Until I choose otherwise.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/ARCYes05=Ulas zavir.

VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCDeath01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCDeath02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCDeath03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCHelp00=May this battle bring us glory!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed00=I serve the Firstborn.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed01=Our fate lies with our homeland. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed02=Many of our people have fallen... but their deaths will not be in vain.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed03=The enemy has changed, and so must we.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed04=I imagine that Adun never thought he'd see someone like me.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed05=What do you call an Aiur protoss who can meld with the shadows? Hm... Overpowered!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCPissed06=I am but ONE avenger. Please do not refer to us in the plural form. 
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCReady00=Vengeance for Aiur.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat00=We will atone.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat01=There is no solace in exile.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat02=Give your order.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat03=Retribution awaits.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat04=Our day will come.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat05=Aiur shall rise anew.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCWhat06=Glory through perseverance.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCYes00=With pride!
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCYes01=As you say.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCYes02=So shall it be.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCYes03=We obey.
VoiceOver/Avenger/ARCYes04=En aras addari.

VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARCYes05=Prepared to engage.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARCYes06=Justice is served.
VoiceOver/CarrierVoid/ARCYes07=The battle is won.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack00=Hold nothing back!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack01=I have but one life to give!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack02=Let me die honorable.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack03=By the grace of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack04=Zhakul guilda!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack05=They shall be disrupted...
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCAttack06=I fight to the end.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCHelp00=The battle begins!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed00=These skies are mine.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed01=Look at all the pretty lights!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed02=I wonder what this button does.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed03=I think this was a big mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed04=You might even say... a huge mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed05=If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed06=I must stop staring at the sun.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed07=Corners like it's on rails.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCPissed08=I feel the need... the need for... an ejector seat! Look out!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCReady00=It is a good day to die.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCWhat00=Ready for battle.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCWhat01=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCWhat02=Let us attack!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCWhat03=May I be of service?

VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCWhat05=The skies beckon.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes00=Adun Toridas!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes01=Ah, at last!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes02=I thought you'd see it my way.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes03=Eyes to the horizon.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes04=Joh'gaav!
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes05=The sky is my battlefield.
VoiceOver/Corsair/ARCYes06=I shall be swift.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack00=Wrath...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack01=Your energy is ours...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack02=Consume.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack03=Darkness overpowering!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack04=Feeble minds...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack05=Unending torment.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCAttack06=Smolder...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCHelp00=Conflict arises.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed00=Aldaris... Betrayer, betrayed.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed01=We live... In times of great need...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed02=Once you go Dark Archon... you never come back...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed03=Do not tempt us... Your mind is not as strong as you think.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed04=Ulreazj lives on... We feel his rage.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed05=The Void... filled with hatred... it mirrors our own.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCPissed06=Our existence... is suffering... do not prolong it.
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCReady00=We are as one...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCWhat00=Must have energy...

VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCYes02=We move...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCYes03=<ghostly moan>
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCYes04=As you say...
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCYes05=Energy... Need energy!
VoiceOver/DarkArchon/ARCYes06=The Void burns...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCHelp00=Battle is upon us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed00=By the shadows...
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed02=The shadows writhe around me. 
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed03=I stalk the night.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed04=Raszagal, watch over us!
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed05=I hear an ancient voice whispering from the Void... and it chills my lightless heart.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed_Alt00=By the shadows of Shakuras.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed_Alt01=Twilight falls upon us all.
VoiceOver/DarkTemplarVoid/ARCPissed_Alt02=The shadows writhe around me.

VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed02=The flames of Alarak's wrath will purge this universe of Amon's worshippers. And I shall be the instrument of their destruction.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed03=I feel like destroying something beautiful. To be fair, I always feel this way.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed04=This vessel has as much in common with a void ray as a spear does with a twig.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed05=Show me your foes. And I shall destroy them! Burn them to ash! And then, I'll destroy the ash. Muahaha.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed06=The Nerazim have constructed an Annihilator? Perhaps we have more in common than we think.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCPissed07=I yearn to fly through the darkened skies of Slayn. And then DESTROY them.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/ARCReady00=The Death Fleet descends.

VoiceOver/Fenix/ARCPissed00=On this battlefield I seek only glorious combat. We need not speak, Hierarch, our blades shall speak for us.
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARCPissed01=What is it you seek, my friend?
VoiceOver/Fenix/ARCPissed02=It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.

VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed02=I have known only an eternity of war.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed03=My resolve is unending.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed04=There can be only one.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed05=Back in my day I had to teleport to and from school in the snow. Uphill both dimensions.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed06=Youth is wasted on the young.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed07=Where is my walker...? Oh, I'm in it.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCPissed08=The second thing to go is your memory. I can't remember what the first thing is.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCYes00=It is destined.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/ARCYes01=Ik s'abeel. (Translation: It is destined.)

VoiceOver/Karax/ARCDeath00=I die... a Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCHelp00=I am engaging our foe.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed00=The task ahead of us is difficult, but worthwhile.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed01=I see the grand design behind it all. The intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed02=These psionic storms are growing worse. Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed03=It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed04=I hope my drones are doing alright up there...
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed05=It has only been a short while since we returned to Aiur and had to flee from it. Yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed06=The Khalai long served the firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams and now we are all equal.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCPissed07=I am a phase-smith and I am a Templar... Fenix was right, it is indeed a glorious day.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCReady00=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat00=Yes, Hierarch? 
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat01=My expertise is yours.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat02=What may I resolve? 
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat03=I will find the solution.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat04=I hear you.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat05=We are all Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat06=Amon shall not prevail.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat07=Na ku a'fal Aiur. (Translation: We shall avenge Aiur!)
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCWhat08=A phase-smith is always prepared.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes00=It will be.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes01=I concur.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes02=We are united.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes03=The psi-matrix will fall.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes04=Progress is made by the bold.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes05=Shan-ala-ari Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes06=Purpose guides us.
VoiceOver/Karax/ARCYes07=Aiur will be restored.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack00=My power is vast.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack01=You will not decide our fate!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack02=Be gone.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack03=Your time has ended.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack04=I am unstoppable.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack05=I sense their fear...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCAttack06=All shall be one with the light!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCDeath00=This was not to be...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCHelp00=I strike at the enemy!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed00=So long as Amon lives, we are all in peril.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed01=I will bring peace to the cosmos.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed02=So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed03=I am the culmination of prophecy.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed04=I can see everything now... 
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed05=...the thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed06=Alone, we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCPissed07=That bond must sustain us now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCReady00=I am infinite.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat00=What is it you require?
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat01=Speak to me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat02=My destiny manifests.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat03=Infinity unravels before me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat04=A new age will dawn.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat05=Amon shall meet his end.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCWhat06=I can see... countless universes.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes00=The final stand begins now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes01=I am called.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes02=I cannot delay.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes03=This is my burden to bear.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes04=I will not fail.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/ARCYes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack00=You're in my way...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack01=No mercy.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack02=Death awaits you!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack03=I sense your fear.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack04=Slay them all!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack05=This is what you deserve.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCAttack06=Whatever it takes.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCDeath00=This isn't over...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCHelp00=The fight begins.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed00=My true enemy waits in the darkness.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed01=Amon and his hybrid will die.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed02=This is the true war--the one that could end everything.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed03=I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis. 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed04=Are you trying to annoy me?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed05=Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed06=I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed07=I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCPissed08=So much has happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years... 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCReady00=I will not be stopped.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat00=What is it, already?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat01=Speak.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat02=Yes?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat03=Your queen listens.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat04=You have my attention.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat05=Explain yourself.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCWhat06=Make it quick.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes00=I am the Swarm.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes01=Boldly.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes02=No time like the present.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes03=My search continues...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes04=I've come this far.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/ARCYes05=I need answers.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack00=Initiating purification.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack01=They shall be cleansed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack02=Sanitizing.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack03=Righteous fury burns brightest.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack04=Priming weapon systems.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack05=Rono hashik. (Translation: Directive confirmed.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCAttack06=Eliminating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCHelp00=Target in range.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed00=The Purifiers heed your call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed01=Honor our sacrifice.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed02=We have chosen the path of duty. We ask only for the respect we are owed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed03=I pledged my life to the Templar... What have you done?
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed04=Ask not what your robotic warrior can do for you, but what you can do for your robotic warrior.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed05=What can you do for me? Well... I would like some weapons upgrades.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed06=And... perhaps some high capacity power fluctuators...
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed07=Hm, that new trillic compression mesh looks very imposing, does it not?
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed08=And would a fresh coat of paint be too much to add? It has been millennia, after all.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCPissed09=It takes a lot of work to look this good after thousands of years.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCReady00=I return to the skies.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat00=I soar again.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat01=I answer the call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat02=All systems ready.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat03=Activating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat04=Too long have I rested.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat05=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCWhat06=War has no end.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes00=Assigning navigation.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes01=Lokh-tai. (Translation: Immediately.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes02=Calibrating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes03=Order received.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes04=O verash. (Translation: I understand.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes05=Complying.
VoiceOver/Mirage/ARCYes06=Taking flight.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack00=Ascension through battle!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack01=They shall flee before me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack02=For the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack03=They shall die most painfully.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack04=My triumph awaits.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack05=No one stands against me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCAttack06=Vok'az Shirol!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCHelp00=Commencing bloodshed.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed00=Weakness is a path to death.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed01=The Templar have words... The Tal'darim have blades!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed02=Before we became the Chosen, we were the Forged. And we can never be broken.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed03=We do not waste time with engineering and manufacture. The weak provide our weapons and our ships.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed04=Piloting a ship is no more complicated than wielding a blade. I know what every panel in this vessel does! Except... this one.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed05=<Button pressing sound effect> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed06=<Beeping sound effect> No! Cease that infernal noise! Do not make me turn this ship around!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed07=<Beeping sound effect continues> Argh! Be silent! <Smashing sound, then all is quiet>
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCPissed08=There. Now for you... I may not be your real mothership, but you still have to obey me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCReady00=Victory has come.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat00=You presume to speak?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat01=Impress me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat02=This had better be worthwhile.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat03=I will not suffer fools.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat04=Fealty unto the Highlord.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat05=We are the soul of strength.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCWhat06=My will is iron.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes00=A fine scheme.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes01=We are in agreement... this time.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes02=So long as it leads to glory.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes03=By our birthright.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes04=I shall indulge.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes05=A worthy order.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/ARCYes06=Rik'kan thok ishar.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCHelp00=Engaging the enemy!

VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed02=We shall rise from the ashes!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed03=Valor is my shield!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed04=I used to have a lot of nerve... cords.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed05=Transmute!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed06=Second star on the right, straight on 'til morning.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed07=We push ourselves to the end. And when we reach it, we push farther. (Beat) So I guess that's not really "the end", is it?
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/ARCPissed08=Justice for all!... Except the zerg.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack00=My blade thirsts.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack01=Death is a gift.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack02=They will be purged.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack03=The culling begins.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack04=Executing.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCAttack05=Nothing will remain...
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCDeath00=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCDeath01=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCDeath02=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCHelp00=I shall relish this battle!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed00=I stalk the weak.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed01=You have disappointments... I have solutions.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed02=Only warriors deserve the honor of fair combat. I eliminate the rest.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed03=They are always too foolish to sense my presence... until it's too late.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed04=The frail must die so the strong can thrive. Such is the way of Rak'Shir--such is the way of the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed05=You may find our ways harsh, templar. But it is better to be harsh than pathetic.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCPissed06=Does your Hierarch listen to you? Because I don't.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCReady00=I seek the unworthy.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat00=Ah, the scent of fear.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat01=I sense...weakness. Frailty.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat02=Where does my prey hide?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat03=My search goes on.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat04=I yearn for slaughter.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCWhat05=Blood will be spilled.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes00=If you are certain.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes01=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes02=With pleasure.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes03=Yes?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes04=Viras Rakan!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes05=Skosal vin'shir.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes06=I hunt.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/ARCYes07=It shall be so.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack00=Let their blood be spilled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack01=Death has come for you.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack02=This is why I live.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack03=The slaughter begins.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack04=I will enjoy this.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack05=Your reckoning is at hand.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack06=Be afraid.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack07=Nowhere to run.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCAttack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath00=I do not... fear death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath01=I see... the Void...
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCDeath_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCHelp00=The enemy seeks my death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed00=The disgraced are forced to become Vanguards. The truly loyal choose to become Slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed01=Wherever you go... there I am.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed02=Don't blink.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed03=The Nerazim's stalkers are pathetic. They should move on with their lives.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed04=Don't worry if you find me hard to hit. It's just a phase.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed05=Before you see the Void... you must DIE.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCPissed06=In every generation, there are the chosen ones. Together, they will stand against the enemies of the Tal'darim. They are the slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCReady00=Fear the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCReady_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat00=Death awaits.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat01=I am the Highlord's weapon.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat02=Our enemies shall suffer.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat03=I have made my choice.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat04=Set me loose upon our foes.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat05=The weak will be culled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCWhat_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes00=I move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes01=As Alarak commands.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes02=Deadly.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes03=I pursue.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes04=Hunt and kill.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes05=None can hide.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes06=Of course.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/ARCYes07=I sense their fear.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack00=Death comes to all.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack01=Dum adu'nala. (Translation: Death comes to all.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack02=The Void hungers....
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack03=Cold fury.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack04=Antu kahl. (Translation: Cold fury.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack05=Forever sleep.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack06=Complete the cycle.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCAttack07=For Shakuras!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCDeath00=Finally...
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCHelp00=Let our enemy know our fury!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCHelp_Alt00=Fall back to the shadows!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed00=My heart is colder than these steel limbs.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed01=Twilight comes as it must.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed02=We are all but shadows in the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed03=I hear the call of the stars.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed04=Night falls. And so will you.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed05=I am one with the darkness... (Crashing sound) Ouch! That hurt.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed06=You look better in the dark.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed07=Don't blink.... Or you''ll miss me.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed08=Now you see me... now you don't. Oh, wait... here I am. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed09=You went to bed early last night.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed10=I see you turned off your phone.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed11=You never return my calls.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed12=I'm your biggest fan.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed13=Restraining order? What about our love?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCPissed14=I have pictures of you. Hundreds.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat00=Cold is the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat01=I am the heart of darkness.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat02=You require my skills?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat03=I am the voice of the eclipse.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat04=State thy bidding. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCWhat05=We are one with the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes00=Very well.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes01=It shall be as you say.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes02=Intriguing.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes03=Veraku. (Translation: Intriguing.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes04=I serve... for now.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes05=We move unseen.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes06=For the reckoning.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/ARCYes07=Very wise. 
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARCAttack00=I protect.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARCAttack01=Guarding.
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARCAttack02=Sacred land...
VoiceOver/StoneZealot/ARCAttack03=Aiur's foes burn.

VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed01=The Purifiers will retake their rightful place among the Templar.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed02=Your Hierarch is unlike the Judicators we have known. He is a bright spark in a series of shadows.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed03=We protoss have many ways of surviving the brutalities of battle. But only the way of the Purifiers ensures eternal life.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed04=I do wish I had considered the Conclave's preconceived notions about robotic intelligence before joining the Purifier program.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed05=Communication matrices nearing maximum capacity. Recalibrating memory web.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed06=Error 0b100101, response not found.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCPissed07=I am the true hero of the storm.

VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCYes01=As it was in the days of old.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/ARCYes02=We stand with the Firstborn.

VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCDeath01=I am but memory.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCHelp00=The fires of conflict burn bright.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed00=Even broken links can be made to serve the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed01=I am the last link in the chain of ascension. I am a Vanguard, and only my death shall have meaning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed02=Forgiveness is a Templar virtue. I seek only for my failures to be forgotten.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed03=We are the first to battle, and if fate smiles upon us, we shall never return.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed04=You Templar refer to your assault striders as "Immortals". Our cultures are quite different, indeed.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed05=To think of the trouble the Tal'darim have caused the Templar. Be thankful you never encountered the Venti'darim.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCPissed06=I tire, and my thoughts darken. Leave me to them.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCReady00=The hour is upon us.

VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCYes04=As the chain commands.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCYes05=I obey.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCYes06=Unquestioned.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/ARCYes07=We advance.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCHelp00=We face the enemy!
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed00=All paths are seen through the prism of fate.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed01=United in purpose, we serve the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed02=Conflict must not be seen through the lens of desperation.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed03=Infinity burns around us.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed04=There is no greater void than the one between your ears.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed05=I am also null.
VoiceOver/VoidRayVoid/ARCPissed06=Always bet on void.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack00=The path to victory awaits!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack01=For our homeland!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack02=Zhakan s'ak-ash! (Translation: The shadows are my shield!)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack03=The shadows are my shield!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack04=Twilight enshrouds me.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack05=This shall be our day of triumph.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCAttack06=Zhakul gulida! (Translation: Darkness awaits!)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCDeath00=Our legacy lives on...
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCHelp00=I strike at our foe!
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed00=Together, we shall ensure the future of our people.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed01=Our blades burn brightest in dark times.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed02=This is the greatest battle we could ever hope to win.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed03=I am Matriarch of the Nerazim. We have sheltered our brethren from Aiur, yet our differences persist.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed04=I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed05=Not that we wouldn't enjoy watching you try.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCPissed06=But... that is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCReady00=The Nerazim will answer.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat01=What is your will?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat02=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat03=Nas beru s'adarr? (Translation: You seek my service?)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat04=We must form a plan.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat05=You require counsel?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCWhat06=There is little time.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes00=En aru'din Shakuras. (Translation: In memory of Shakuras.)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes01=We stand with our allies.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes02=Our future is the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes03=Neraz gulio. (Translation: Truth before authority.)
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes04=It is my honor.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/ARCYes05=There is much to be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack00=Blades of justice!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack01=It must be done.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack02=None shall stand!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack03=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack04=We strike as one!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack05=Our fury is boundless.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCAttack06=None can withstand the Templar!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCDeath00=For Aiur...
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCHelp00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed00=I am Templar. I am the sword of truth.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed01=Combat is the anvil of will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed02=Our enemies must be eradicated.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed03=Victory is the only truth that matters.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed04=Fear is for the enemy. 
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed05=Do not make me count to zmidlarj.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed06=It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCPissed07=How peaceful it must be for you, to have a mind unburdened by thought.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCReady00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat02=Command me.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat05=We stand unified.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCWhat06=Na adan daelaam.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes00=Honor guides me.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes01=En taro Tassadar!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes02=By your will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes03=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes04=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/Zealot/ARCYes05=For Artanis!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack00=Vengeance is at hand.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack01=Blood for blood.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack02=My death awaits.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack03=Ascension for the fallen.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack04=Remember me.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack05=I will not die alone.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack06=My purpose is fulfilled.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCAttack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath00=Victory through death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath01=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCDeath_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCHelp00=We strike at the Highlord's foes.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed00=I will be of use, dead or alive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed01=If Alarak wishes my death, he need only ask.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed02=It is a thankless job, but someone has to do it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed03=All supplicants must die. All supplicants must serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed04=Ah, the Breath of Creation. More like the Breath of Recreation, am I right?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed05=There was once a Supplicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest of us. He was a Tall-darim.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed06=Okay, maybe I deserve to die for that one.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed07=A few of the other supplicants and I have a bet going over which of us dies first. We call it... the "dead league." We're still working on the name.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCPissed08=Witness me!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCReady00=My life for the Highlord.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCReady_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat00=I will adhere to the chain.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat01=Awaiting your decree.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat02=Eternal obedience.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat03=My sacrifice will have meaning.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat04=Loyalty unto death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat05=I am a servant of Slayn.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat06=Oblivion beckons.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCWhat_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes00=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes01=I live to serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes02=My fate is in your hands.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes03=For Alarak.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes04=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/ARCYes05=Without remorse.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack00=The shadow descends.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack01=Break before us!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack02=Your end has come.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack03=Zerashk gulida!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack04=Face the endless Void!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack05=May our blades strike true.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCAttack06=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCDeath00=Void embrace me.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCDeath01=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCDeath02=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCDeath03=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCDeath04=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCHelp00=Our blades meet the enemy.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed00=I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed01=Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed02=We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed03=Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred Centurions. Never more, never less. Unless one falls in battle, and then we replace them... quickly.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed04=What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed05=Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us merely bend it to our will, from time to time.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed06=We fashion armor from the bones of our prey. It is a grand tradition reminding us of how far we have come... No. We do not have "jaw envy."
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCPissed07=The Templar zealots won't admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCReady00=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat00=The Shadow Guard waits.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat01=Give us your command.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat02=We stand watch.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat03=Na adan sai'osh.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat04=Ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat05=We await our charge.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCWhat06=None shall break us.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes00=So be it.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes01=Your command is law.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes02=For Vorazun!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes03=The guard moves.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes04=We shall shield this world.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/ARCYes05=Eternally resolute.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack00=Executing.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack01=As the Hierarch wills.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack02=Know the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack03=We are the overwhelming tide.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack04=Your purification is at hand!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack05=To glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCAttack06=Be undone!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCDeath00=Releasing consciousness.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCHelp00=We meet the enemy in battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed00=I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed01=Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed02=We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed03=It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed04=Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed05=Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed06=When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCPissed07=A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCReady00=This warrior awakens.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat00=Listening.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat01=Guide my blade.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat02=The enemy shall be purified.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat03=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat04=Speak your demands.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat05=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCWhat06=Identify our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes00=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes01=Protocols aligned.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes02=With honor.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes03=My blade yearns to meet our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes04=For Fenix!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/ARCYes05=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/ZealotShakuras/ARCReady00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCHelp00=We embrace the glory of battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat05=We stand unified.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat06=Na adan Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt05=We stand as one.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/ARCWhat_Alt06=Na adan atum.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCAttack00=There is much to answer for.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCAttack01=The scales will be balanced.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCAttack02=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCAttack03=Oblivion descends!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCAttack04=We must act!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCDeath00=The Void... beckons.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCHelp00=My enemies close in!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCHelp01=I face a new trial.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed00=I stand at the threshold of destiny.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed01=Only the truth can lead us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed02=The xel'naga have given us the keys to our future.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed03=We must be ever watching... ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed04=I suspect vigilance is one of your... weaker attributes.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed05=Kindly leave me to my meditation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed06=How am I to avert disaster with your constant meddling?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCPissed07=I see. This is but another test.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCReady00=I will find hope for our people.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCWhat00=I seek the path of salvation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCWhat01=My burdens weigh heavily.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCWhat02=You address me?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCWhat03=I bring wisdom in times of chaos.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCWhat04=S'shozak mok nul.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes00=I shall find a way.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes01=Glory to the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes02=Honor commands.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes03=En aru'din Raszagal.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes04=We must not hesitate.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes05=The prophecy guides us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes06=My allegiance is yours.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/ARCYes07=I will fulfill my calling.
