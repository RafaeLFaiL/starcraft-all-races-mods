Conversation/AICommunication/Line00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00044=We must retreat!

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00109=It's a little too crazy out here.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00112=Done scouting.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00148=This building is terran in origin.

Conversation/AICommunication/Line00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/Line00168=We're pulling back.

Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00033=In order to succeed, you will need to use your SCVs to repair your structures and to fight back against the aggressors.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00034=En Taro Tassadar, student. In this simulation, you will learn to control large forces more efficiently.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00035=Begin by organizing your forces into control groups. Examine the units available to you and distribute them into powerful attack groups.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00036=As you can see, you have units stationed throughout the simulation area. These are in stasis until you are ready to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00037=Round 1
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00038=Welcome back, Commander. A strong economy is key to victory, and the key to a strong economy is efficient resource gathering.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00039=In this exercise your base management skills will be challenged. Begin by collecting sufficient resources to expand to the extra resource area nearby. 
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00040=By building a second command center at the expansion site, you will effectively double the amount of resources you receive.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00041=Complete the exercise by training a force before the time runs out.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00042=Good morning, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to survive through several waves of attackers.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00043=Each wave will be challenging to overcome with the forces available. Directly controlling the actions of your units will give you the edge you need to prevail.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00044=Press the ready button when you wish to begin.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00045=Welcome, Commander. Your objective in this exercise is to inflict maximum possible damage using only the siege tanks and medivac dropships allocated.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00046=You will have a limited amount of time to destroy as much of the enemy base as possible. Scouting the base with your medivacs before making your assault is advised.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00047=Enemy forces cannot be harmed until you press the ready button, so conduct your scouting carefully.
Conversation/Challengescombined/Line00048=Once you are ready, strike swiftly! Destroy as many enemies as possible before time runs out!

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Group00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00005=All the while... a human civil war raged.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00007=Uh, boys? How about that evac?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00008=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00009=It's done. Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit. Now!
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00011=But the zerg had other plans.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00024=It was Tassadar who kept the templar from extinction that day.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00079=The war seemed to end there.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00080=...was attempting to merge protoss and zerg life forms into an unholy hybrid.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00081=...of Kerrigan and her power.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/Line00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.

Conversation/Tutorial/Line00001=In StarCraft II you view the battle from above as the commander of an army. You use your mouse to control your view of the battlefield and give instructions to the units under your command.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00002=In the lower left of your screen is a minimap that allows you to see what is happening all over the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00003=In the lower right of your screen you can find the command card. The command card is used to issue orders to selected units.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00004=The lower middle of your screen is the unit information panel. This shows information about the units or structures you have selected.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00005=Above the command card is the "Tip" button. The "Tip" button appears when there is new information for your perusal. Simply click the "Tip" button to read the tip.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00006=To change your view, move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen. When your mouse touches the edge of the screen, your view will slide in that direction.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00007=You can also use the minimap to shift your view to any part of the battlefield. Simply left-click on the minimap to jump to a new location.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00008=Now that you have a unit selected, right-click on the ground to order the unit to move somewhere.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00009=To move a unit you must first select it. Use your mouse and left-click on the unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00010=Well done commander.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00011=To attack an enemy, select your units and right-click on the enemy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00012=During the attack, you can mouse over the enemy to see a bar representing their life. A unit is destroyed when its hit-points reach zero. You can also mouse over your own units to keep an eye on their life bars.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00013=You can also use the attack move command to tell your units to move to a location and attack any enemy forces they encounter along the way.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00014=To make an attack-move command, left-click on the attack button from the command card while your units are selected, and then left-click on the ground where you want your units to go.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00015=To create a new terran structure, first select an SCV by left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00016=Now left-click the "Build Structure" button in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00017=Left-click on the structure you want to build and then left-click anywhere on the ground to order the SCV to place the new structure. The SCV will move to your chosen location, and build the structure there.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00018=The Command Center cannot be constructed too close to minerals. When placing the Command Center look for the overlay to be completely green before left-clicking.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00019=SCVs are your primary means of collecting resources. While your SCV is selected, right-click a mineral field to begin collecting resources.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00020=Your SCV will start harvesting minerals and dropping them off at the closest Command Center.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00021=You can train more SCVs from the Command Center to gather minerals faster.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00022=Your SCV will continue harvesting until you order it to do something else.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00023=Well done commander. Harvesting minerals is central to any terran strategy.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00024=To create new units, you must first select a structure that trains units. Select a Barracks to see what units you can train from it. Those units will appear in the command card in the lower right of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00025=Left-click on the "Marine" button in the command card to order the Barracks to begin training that unit. Once the unit is complete, it will appear next to the Barracks.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00026=You can queue multiple units at the same time. Simply click on the button again to add another Marine to the queue.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00027=Before you can train a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to train that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00028=To increase the maximum number of units available, you must build supply depots. To do this, select an SCV and left-click the Build Structures button. Left-click on Build Supply Depot and left-click anywhere to place the Supply Depot.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00029=Your current supply maximum is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen along with how much supply you are currently using.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00030=The Zerg are a savage alien race made up of a host of different species that all mutate from a single creature type called a Larva.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00031=The Zerg create a thick layer of bio-matter called creep under all of their bases and use creatures called Overlords to provide supply for their armies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00032=Many Zerg creatures can morph from one form to another on the battlefield. Zerg structures can also mutate from one form to another, growing more powerful and unlocking new unit types as they do.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00033=The Drone is consumed when the structure is created, so you will need another Drone to build another structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00034=Creep is an organic growth that spreads around any Zerg base. Most Zerg units will move more quickly when they're on creep, and all Zerg structures except Hatcheries must be built on it. Structures that are no longer on creep will slowly die.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00035=Creep is generated by Hatcheries, Queens, and Overlords, so you can use these units and structures to expand your creep.   
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00036=To mutate a Zerg structure, first select a Drone. On the command card left-click the Basic Mutation button and left-click again to choose a Hatchery. Then left-click to place the Hatchery.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00037=The Hatchery cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Hatchery look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00038=Zerg units are created from Larva. To create a Zerg Drone, left-click on a Hatchery and then left-click on the select larva button on the command card.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00039=With a larva selected you can left-click on the Morph to Drone button in the command card to order the larva to morph into a Drone.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00040=Each Hatchery generates additional larva over time.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00041=To create a Protoss structure, select a probe and left-click on the Build Structures button on the command card. Then left-click Warp in Nexus and left-click the ground to create that structure.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00042=The Nexus cannot be placed too close to minerals. When trying to place the Nexus look for the structure overlay to be completely green before placing.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00043=Before you can warp in a unit, you must have the supplies to support that unit. If you do not have enough available supply, you will not be able to warp in that unit.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00044=The Protoss are an ancient alien race that employ advanced technologies and powerful psionics to defeat their enemies.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00045=Protoss have shields on their units and structures to protect them from enemy attacks. Shield strength is represented by a blue bar above the hit-point bar.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00046=Shields are reduced by enemy attacks in the same manner as hit-points, however shields regenerate quickly after combat has finished. 
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00047=Xel'Naga Watch Towers can be controlled by any player. Place a unit near the Watch Tower to activate it and reveal a large area of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00048=If several players have units near a Watch Tower then the tower is not controlled and no player can activate it.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00049=Some obstacles can be destroyed by weapons fire, and you can attack obstacles to clear a path for your troops.  
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00050=Some features like shrubs and smoke will block your vision. Your units can move through these features freely but only flying units can see past them.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00051=You can put your units into control groups. This makes it easy to quickly select a group of units.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00052=To create a control group, select your units and left-click the Control Group button. You can find the Control Group button above the information panel in the lower middle of your screen.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00053=You can hold down the Shift key on your keyboard to give a unit a large number of orders. The unit will then carry out those orders one after another.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00054=This allows you to give a series of commands to one unit and then move on to command other units in another part of the battlefield.
Conversation/Tutorial/Line00055=To chat with people in your game, hit the Enter key and then type a message.  When your message is finished hit Enter again to send it.

Conversation/MechGunner/Line00047=I've lost control of the cyclone!
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00048=I think they're issuing it orders.
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00049=Should we call tech support?
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00050=I jiggled the cable, but nothing happened.
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00051=Everything about this is gross.
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00052=Ew, it's like they're trying to communicate.
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00053=I don't know... Reboot it again!
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00054=My cyclone's under zerg control!

Conversation/MechGunner/Line00063=Where are they moving it to now?
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00066=Can we report it's location? No?
Conversation/MechGunner/Line00067=Cameras show it's moving somewhere.

Conversation/RobotPusher/Line00030=Do you even possess any wisdom?
Conversation/RobotPusher/Line00031=I thought I would be surrounded by the best and the brightest if I became a Purifier. Instead, the future is full of idiots. 
Conversation/RobotPusher/Line00032=Life as an artificial intelligence is really not so bad. You might even say... it's ballin'.
Conversation/RobotPusher/Line00033=<HAL impression> I am completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly... Just ask the kalathi.
Conversation/RobotPusher/Line00034=Ow! Why was I programmed to feel pain?

VoiceOver/Adept/Pissed04=I say, why not be both?
VoiceOver/Adept/Pissed05=With the right training anyone can be in two places at once, but their mind must be fully open. Oh, and they need a psionic amplifier. That helps too.
VoiceOver/Adept/Pissed06=Chasing after your own shade is a pointless endeavor. I mean it moves so quickly!
VoiceOver/Adept/Pissed07=Why yes, you could say I have some skill. <laughs>
VoiceOver/Adept/Pissed08=What? Just because I'm called an adept doesn't mean I need to brag about it.

VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed02=Uh... I'm kinda out of jokes, man. I'm not really a jokey kinda guy.
VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed03=Gonna just keep poking me anyway, huh? Look, can we get back to fighting? I'm actually good at that!
VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed04=How about I make this real simple. You point them out, then I risk my neck by driving right up to them... then, get this, I kill them. Sound good?
VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed05=Okay, so this is you: "Hey, Cyclone. What you doing?" Then I'm like, "Nothing, I just want to go kill things!"
VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed06="Well how 'bout we have a nice long talk instead?" "Gee, I dunno, boss. That sounds pretty awful. Maybe we could just stop this whole thing and get back to shooting stuff."
VoiceOver/Cyclone/Pissed07="No, I'm just going to keep on doing it. Blah bla-blah bla-blah. Poke poke poke!"

VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/Pissed04=We've learned a lot about transforming vehicles since the Viking. Hell, I've only had one crewman snap his spine this week.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/Pissed05=Don't tell anyone, but I once piloted a Conservator. Yeah... But it was in college... so ya know... it doesn't count.
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/Pissed06=I'm a strong believer in personal liberty. That every person has the liberty to do precisely as they are told, or be to put to death. <Maniacal laughter>
VoiceOver/TerranFlyer/Pissed07=Wow, Liberator to dictator in 5 seconds. That's gotta be some kind of record!

VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed00=My patience runs short, Templar. Do not press me further.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed01=Are you incapable of listening? Or just comprehending?
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed02=So this is the zerg... the "great enemy" who brought the Templar so low? How utterly disappointing.
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed03=Bow before your Highlord and submit completely to my rule. Really!?!
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed04=Oh, Hierarch. Is this how you spend your free time? No wonder these "missions" of yours take so very very long...
VoiceOver/Alarak/Pissed05=There are fates worse than death, you know. I could have you extract terrazine until you lose your mind like that fool Nyon.

VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed01=We judicators are eternally grateful that our Hierarch has allowed us to serve Aiur once more.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed02=And yet, you Templar are still wary of our actions. Our desire to fight for our homeworld is equal to any other.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed03=You desire a lesson in time travel? Very well.
VoiceOver/Arbiter/Pissed04=To understand time you must first conceive it. Think of a flat circle. Now, imagine twenty five million circles intersecting that circle at different points from the center.

VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed01=But through Rak'shir we find ascension.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed02=My thoughts are guided by the terrazine mists. Amon knows we are coming, he knows we shall claim our vengeance.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed03=You are simply unaware of the gifts granted to us through the breath of creation... the unseen truths it brings to light...
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed04=Shakuras has fallen... Aiur has fallen... Does that mean all of these structures were constructed aboard the Spear of Adun?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed05=If an immortal dies, does that mean it was never an immortal to begin with?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed06=What if our entire universe was just a game being played by beings of incredible power?
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed07=And then there were beings watching those beings play their games instead of actually playing the games themselves.
VoiceOver/Ascendant/Pissed08=Ow. I'm twitching... Perhaps I should limit my terrazine intake... for a while.

VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed00=These skies are mine.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed01=Look at all the pretty lights!
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed02=I wonder what this button does.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed03=I think this was a big mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed04=You might even say... a huge mistake.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed05=If only I hadn't fallen asleep during my break lessons.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed06=I must stop staring at the sun.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed07=Corners like it's on rails.
VoiceOver/Corsair/Pissed08=I feel the need... the need for... an ejector seat! Look out!

VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed00=Creation is meaningless, even a mindless organism can create.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed01=Destruction, however... one's will imposed upon the universe, that is true expression.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed02=The flames of Alarak's wrath will purge this universe of Amon's worshippers. And I shall be the instrument of their destruction.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed03=I feel like destroying something beautiful. To be fair, I always feel this way.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed04=This vessel has as much in common with a void ray as a spear does with a twig.
VoiceOver/Destroyer/Pissed05=Show me your foes. And I shall destroy them! Burn them to ash! And then, I'll destroy the ash. Muahaha.

VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed00=On this battlefield I seek only glorious combat. We need not speak, Hierarch, our blades shall speak for us.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed01=What is it you seek, my friend?
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed02=It is in the forge of combat that I feel closest to Fenix's memories. I can see clearly through his eyes.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed03=As he tore through his enemies, Fenix would repeat to himself a code he lived by. That reminded him why he fought.
VoiceOver/Fenix/Pissed04=I fear no enemy. For the khala is my strength.

VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed00=With the Khala fallen to corruption, the memories of our ancestors are lost to us.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed01=For the first time, the halls of the Templar Archives are silent.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed02=It has been difficult to bear.
VoiceOver/HighTemplarVoid/Pissed03=Without the Khala to rely on our power has proven difficult to control, but not impossible.

VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed00=My memory is not what it was....
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed01=These steel limbs are not my own.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed02=I have known only an eternity of war.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed03=My resolve is unending.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed04=There can be only one.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed05=Back in my day I had to teleport to and from school in the snow. Uphill both dimensions.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed06=Youth is wasted on the young.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed07=Where is my walker...? Oh, I'm in it.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Pissed08=The second thing to go is your memory. I can't remember what the first thing is.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes00=It is destined.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes01=Ik s'abeel. (Translation: It is destined.)
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes02=There shall be a reckoning.
VoiceOver/ImmortalVoid/Yes03=Por zalah!

VoiceOver/Karax/Help00=I am engaging our foe.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed00=The task ahead of us is difficult, but worthwhile.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed01=I see the grand design behind it all. The intricate machinery of the universe and everything within it.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed02=These psionic storms are growing worse. Destroying this power structure will likely cause a catastrophic failure.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed03=It's a shame the Spear of Adun must engage Amon's zerg brood. Its aid would make our task a great deal simpler.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed04=I hope my drones are doing alright up there...
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed05=It has only been a short while since we returned to Aiur and had to flee from it. Yet it seems like a lifetime ago.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed06=The Khalai long served the firstborn. We were the great builders, the dreamers of dreams and now we are all equal.
VoiceOver/Karax/Pissed07=I am a phase-smith and I am a Templar... Fenix was right, it is indeed a glorious day.
VoiceOver/Karax/Ready00=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/Karax/What00=Yes, Hierarch? 
VoiceOver/Karax/What01=My expertise is yours.
VoiceOver/Karax/What02=What may I resolve? 
VoiceOver/Karax/What03=I will find the solution.
VoiceOver/Karax/What04=I hear you.
VoiceOver/Karax/What05=We are all Templar.
VoiceOver/Karax/What06=Amon shall not prevail.
VoiceOver/Karax/What07=Na ku a'fal Aiur. (Translation: We shall avenge Aiur!)
VoiceOver/Karax/What08=A phase-smith is always prepared.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes00=It will be.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes01=I concur.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes02=We are united.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes03=The psi-matrix will fall.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes04=Progress is made by the bold.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes05=Shan-ala-ari Daelaam.
VoiceOver/Karax/Yes06=Purpose guides us.

VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Attack06=All shall be one with the light!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Death00=This was not to be...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Help00=I strike at the enemy!
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed00=So long as Amon lives, we are all in peril.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed01=I will bring peace to the cosmos.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed02=So many universes came before us, all of them turns in the Infinite Cycle...
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed03=I am the culmination of prophecy.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed04=I can see everything now... 
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed05=...the thread of my life interwoven with the threads of many others'.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed06=Alone, we were fragile. But together, we formed a bond that cannot break.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Pissed07=That bond must sustain us now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Ready00=I am infinite.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What00=What is it you require?
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What01=Speak to me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What02=My destiny manifests.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What03=Infinity unravels before me.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What04=A new age will dawn.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What05=Amon shall meet his end.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/What06=I can see... countless universes.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes00=The final stand begins now.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes01=I am called.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes02=I cannot delay.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes03=This is my burden to bear.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes04=I will not fail.
VoiceOver/KerriganEpilogue/Yes05=It shall be.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack00=You're in my way...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack01=No mercy.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack02=Death awaits you!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack03=I sense your fear.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack04=Slay them all!
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack05=This is what you deserve.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Attack06=Whatever it takes.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Death00=This isn't over...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Help00=The fight begins.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed00=My true enemy waits in the darkness.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed01=Amon and his hybrid will die.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed02=This is the true war--the one that could end everything.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed03=I hope your gods have an awfully good explanation for why I ended up here with you, Artanis. 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed04=Are you trying to annoy me?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed05=Well, here's a hint for you... It's working.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed06=I quit infesting terrans, but you're starting to make me reconsider that.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed07=I bet Abathur could mutate you into something real special.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Pissed08=So much has happened. Sometimes the past seven years really feel more like seventeen years... 
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Ready00=I will not be stopped.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What00=What is it, already?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What01=Speak.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What02=Yes?
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What03=Your queen listens.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What04=You have my attention.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What05=Explain yourself.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/What06=Make it quick.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes00=I am the Swarm.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes01=Boldly.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes02=No time like the present.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes03=My search continues...
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes04=I've come this far.
VoiceOver/KerriganVoid/Yes05=I need answers.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Attack00=Initiating purification.

VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed00=The Purifiers heed your call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed01=Honor our sacrifice.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed02=We have chosen the path of duty. We ask only for the respect we are owed.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed03=I pledged my life to the Templar... What have you done?
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed04=Ask not what your robotic warrior can do for you, but what you can do for your robotic warrior.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed05=What can you do for me? Well... I would like some weapons upgrades.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed06=And... perhaps some high capacity power fluctuators...
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed07=Hm, that new trillic compression mesh looks very imposing, does it not?
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed08=And would a fresh coat of paint be too much to add? It has been millennia, after all.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Pissed09=It takes a lot of work to look this good after thousands of years.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Ready00=I return to the skies.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What00=I soar again.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What01=I answer the call.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What02=All systems ready.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What03=Activating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What04=Too long have I rested.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What05=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Mirage/What06=War has no end.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes00=Assigning navigation.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes01=Lokh-tai. (Translation: Immediately.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes02=Calibrating.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes03=Order received.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes04=O verash. (Translation: I understand.)
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes05=Complying.
VoiceOver/Mirage/Yes06=Taking flight.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack00=Ascension through battle!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack01=They shall flee before me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack02=For the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack03=They shall die most painfully.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack04=My triumph awaits.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack05=No one stands against me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Attack06=Vok'az Shirol!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Help00=Commencing bloodshed.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed00=Weakness is a path to death.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed01=The Templar have words... The Tal'darim have blades!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed02=Before we became the Chosen, we were the Forged. And we can never be broken.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed03=We do not waste time with engineering and manufacture. The weak provide our weapons and our ships.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed04=Piloting a ship is no more complicated than wielding a blade. I know what every panel in this vessel does! Except... this one.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed05=<Button pressing sound effect> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed06=<Beeping sound effect> No! Cease that infernal noise! Do not make me turn this ship around!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed07=<Beeping sound effect continues> Argh! Be silent! <Smashing sound, then all is quiet>
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Pissed08=There. Now for you... I may not be your real mothership, but you still have to obey me!
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Ready00=Victory has come.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What00=You presume to speak?
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What01=Impress me.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What02=This had better be worthwhile.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What03=I will not suffer fools.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What04=Fealty unto the Highlord.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What05=We are the soul of strength.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/What06=My will is iron.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes00=A fine scheme.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes01=We are in agreement... this time.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes02=So long as it leads to glory.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes03=By our birthright.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes04=I shall indulge.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes05=A worthy order.
VoiceOver/MothershipVoid/Yes06=Rik'kan thok ishar.

VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed04=I used to have a lot of nerve... cords.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed05=Transmute!
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed06=Second star on the right, straight on 'til morning.
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed07=We push ourselves to the end. And when we reach it, we push farther. (Beat) So I guess that's not really "the end", is it?
VoiceOver/PhoenixVoid/Pissed08=Justice for all!... Except the zerg.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack00=My blade thirsts.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack01=Death is a gift.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack02=They will be purged.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack03=The culling begins.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack04=Executing.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Attack05=Nothing will remain...
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death00=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death01=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Death02=Death Exertion
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Help00=I shall relish this battle!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed00=I stalk the weak.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed01=You have disappointments... I have solutions.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed02=Only warriors deserve the honor of fair combat. I eliminate the rest.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed03=They are always too foolish to sense my presence... until it's too late.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed04=The frail must die so the strong can thrive. Such is the way of Rak'Shir--such is the way of the Tal'darim.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed05=You may find our ways harsh, templar. But it is better to be harsh than pathetic.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Pissed06=Does your Hierarch listen to you? Because I don't.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Ready00=I seek the unworthy.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What00=Ah, the scent of fear.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What01=I sense...weakness. Frailty.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What02=Where does my prey hide?

VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/What04=I yearn for slaughter.

VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes00=If you are certain.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes01=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes02=With pleasure.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes03=Yes?
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes04=Viras Rakan!
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes05=Skosal vin'shir.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes06=I hunt.
VoiceOver/ShadowHunter/Yes07=It shall be so.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack00=Let their blood be spilled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack01=Death has come for you.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack02=This is why I live.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack03=The slaughter begins.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack04=I will enjoy this.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack05=Your reckoning is at hand.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack06=Be afraid.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack07=Nowhere to run.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack_NP00=For the Swarm.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Attack_NP01=I obey.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death00=I do not... fear death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death01=I see... the Void...
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Death_NP00=Service... Complete.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Help00=The enemy seeks my death.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed00=The disgraced are forced to become Vanguards. The truly loyal choose to become Slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed01=Wherever you go... there I am.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed02=Don't blink.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed03=The Nerazim's stalkers are pathetic. They should move on with their lives.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed04=Don't worry if you find me hard to hit. It's just a phase.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed05=Before you see the Void... you must DIE.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Pissed06=In every generation, there are the chosen ones. Together, they will stand against the enemies of the Tal'darim. They are the slayers.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Ready00=Fear the shadows.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What00=Death awaits.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What01=I am the Highlord's weapon.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What02=Our enemies shall suffer.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What03=I have made my choice.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What04=Set me loose upon our foes.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What05=The weak will be culled.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/StalkerAlarak/Yes00=I move unseen.

VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack02=The Void hungers....
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack03=Cold fury.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack04=Antu kahl. (Translation: Cold fury.)
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack05=Forever sleep.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack06=Complete the cycle.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Attack07=For Shakuras!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Death00=Finally...
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Help00=Let our enemy know our fury!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Help_Alt00=Fall back to the shadows!
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed00=My heart is colder than these steel limbs.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed01=Twilight comes as it must.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed02=We are all but shadows in the Void.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed03=I hear the call of the stars.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed04=Night falls. And so will you.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed05=I am one with the darkness... (Crashing sound) Ouch! That hurt.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed06=You look better in the dark.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed07=Don't blink.... Or you''ll miss me.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed08=Now you see me... now you don't. Oh, wait... here I am. 
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed09=You went to bed early last night.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed10=I see you turned off your phone.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed11=You never return my calls.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed12=I'm your biggest fan.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed13=Restraining order? What about our love?
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/Pissed14=I have pictures of you. Hundreds.
VoiceOver/StalkerVoid/What00=Cold is the Void.

VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed01=The Purifiers will retake their rightful place among the Templar.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed02=Your Hierarch is unlike the Judicators we have known. He is a bright spark in a series of shadows.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed03=We protoss have many ways of surviving the brutalities of battle. But only the way of the Purifiers ensures eternal life.
VoiceOver/TempestVoid/Pissed04=I do wish I had considered the Conclave's preconceived notions about robotic intelligence before joining the Purifier program.

VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed00=Even broken links can be made to serve the chain of ascension.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed01=I am the last link in the chain of ascension. I am a Vanguard, and only my death shall have meaning.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed02=Forgiveness is a Templar virtue. I seek only for my failures to be forgotten.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed03=We are the first to battle, and if fate smiles upon us, we shall never return.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed04=You Templar refer to your assault striders as "Immortals". Our cultures are quite different, indeed.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed05=To think of the trouble the Tal'darim have caused the Templar. Be thankful you never encountered the Venti'darim.
VoiceOver/Vanguard/Pissed06=I tire, and my thoughts darken. Leave me to them.

VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed01=Our blades burn brightest in dark times.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed02=This is the greatest battle we could ever hope to win.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed03=I am Matriarch of the Nerazim. We have sheltered our brethren from Aiur, yet our differences persist.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed04=I do not wish to speak ill of the Templar... But let us be honest. Most of you could not complete the Shadow Walk.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed05=Not that we wouldn't enjoy watching you try.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Pissed06=But... that is a matter for times of peace. For now, we are at war.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/Ready00=The Nerazim will answer.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What01=What is your will?
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What02=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/Vorazun/What03=Nas beru s'adarr? (Translation: You seek my service?)

VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed00=I am Templar. I am the sword of truth.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed01=Combat is the anvil of will.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed02=Our enemies must be eradicated.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed03=Victory is the only truth that matters.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed04=Fear is for the enemy. 
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed05=Do not make me count to zmidlarj.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed06=It is said that ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?
VoiceOver/Zealot/Pissed07=How peaceful it must be for you, to have a mind unburdened by thought.
VoiceOver/Zealot/Ready00=My life for Aiur!

VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Help00=We strike at the Highlord's foes.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed00=I will be of use, dead or alive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed01=If Alarak wishes my death, he need only ask.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed02=It is a thankless job, but someone has to do it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed03=All supplicants must die. All supplicants must serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed04=Ah, the Breath of Creation. More like the Breath of Recreation, am I right?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed05=There was once a Supplicant who stood head and shoulders above the rest of us. He was a Tall-darim.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed06=Okay, maybe I deserve to die for that one.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed07=A few of the other supplicants and I have a bet going over which of us dies first. We call it... the "dead league." We're still working on the name.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Pissed08=Witness me!
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Ready00=My life for the Highlord.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Ready_NP00=Assimilation successful.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What00=I will adhere to the chain.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What01=Awaiting your decree.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What02=Eternal obedience.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What03=My sacrifice will have meaning.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What04=Loyalty unto death.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What05=I am a servant of Slayn.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What06=Oblivion beckons.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What_NP00=Your command?
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/What_NP01=Awaiting directive.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes00=As you will it.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes01=I live to serve.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes02=My fate is in your hands.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes03=For Alarak.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes04=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/ZealotAlarak/Yes05=Without remorse.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack00=The shadow descends.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack01=Break before us!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack02=Your end has come.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack03=Zerashk gulida!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack04=Face the endless Void!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack05=May our blades strike true.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Attack06=As fate decrees.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death00=Void embrace me.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death01=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death02=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death03=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Death04=<Death Exertion> 
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Help00=Our blades meet the enemy.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed00=I am Shadow Guard. I am the shield of twilight.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed01=Our duty is bound to the Matriarch's will.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed02=We are the nameless guardians of the Nerazim.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed03=Each legion of Shadow Guard consists of exactly one hundred Centurions. Never more, never less. Unless one falls in battle, and then we replace them... quickly.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed04=What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? I shall tell you once I meet an unstoppable force.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed05=Not all Nerazim can merge themselves with the shadows. Some of us merely bend it to our will, from time to time.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed06=We fashion armor from the bones of our prey. It is a grand tradition reminding us of how far we have come... No. We do not have "jaw envy."
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Pissed07=The Templar zealots won't admit it, but our shadow charge is stunning.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Ready00=I walk the shadowed path.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What00=The Shadow Guard waits.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What01=Give us your command.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What02=We stand watch.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What03=Na adan sai'osh.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What04=Ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What05=We await our charge.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/What06=None shall break us.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes00=So be it.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes01=Your command is law.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes02=For Vorazun!
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes03=The guard moves.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes04=We shall shield this world.
VoiceOver/ZealotNerazim/Yes05=Eternally resolute.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack00=Executing.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack01=As the Hierarch wills.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack02=Know the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack03=We are the overwhelming tide.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack04=Your purification is at hand!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack05=To glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Attack06=Be undone!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Death00=Releasing consciousness.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Help00=We meet the enemy in battle!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed00=I am a Sentinel. I am undying. I am pure.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed01=Glacius may have fallen, but we, its children, live on.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed02=We are the first. The Purifiers, reborn.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed03=It is treatment like this that caused the first generation of Purifiers to rebel against their creators. Do you really wish to test me?
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed04=Test complete. All systems are working perfectly.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed05=Calling me a robotic zealot demeans both me and my people. We prefer mechanical Templar!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed06=When I get knocked down, I get up again. No one will ever keep me down.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Pissed07=A purifier's purity ring represents their commitment to stay pure and to burn anything to death that would attempt to compromise that commitment.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Ready00=This warrior awakens.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What00=Listening.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What01=Guide my blade.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What02=The enemy shall be purified.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What03=I stand ready.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What04=Speak your demands.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What05=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/What06=Identify our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes00=Ul'as addari.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes01=Protocols aligned.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes02=With honor.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes03=My blade yearns to meet our foe.
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes04=For Fenix!
VoiceOver/ZealotPurifier/Yes05=Khassar de templari!
VoiceOver/ZealotShakuras/Ready00=My life for Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/Help00=We embrace the glory of battle!

VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What06=Na adan Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt00=My meditation is over.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt01=Orin shi s'al.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt02=Command me.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt03=Justice be done!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt04=We are the blades of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt05=We stand as one.
VoiceOver/ZealotVoid/What_Alt06=Na adan atum.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack00=There is much to answer for.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack01=The scales will be balanced.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack02=Aruu nal adan!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack03=Oblivion descends!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Attack04=We must act!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Death00=The Void... beckons.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Help00=My enemies close in!
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Help01=I face a new trial.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed00=I stand at the threshold of destiny.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed01=Only the truth can lead us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed02=The xel'naga have given us the keys to our future.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed03=We must be ever watching... ever vigilant.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed04=I suspect vigilance is one of your... weaker attributes.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed05=Kindly leave me to my meditation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed06=How am I to avert disaster with your constant meddling?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Pissed07=I see. This is but another test.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Ready00=I will find hope for our people.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What00=I seek the path of salvation.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What01=My burdens weigh heavily.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What02=You address me?
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What03=I bring wisdom in times of chaos.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/What04=S'shozak mok nul.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes00=I shall find a way.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes01=Glory to the Daelaam.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes02=Honor commands.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes03=En aru'din Raszagal.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes04=We must not hesitate.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes05=The prophecy guides us.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes06=My allegiance is yours.
VoiceOver/ZeratulVoid/Yes07=I will fulfill my calling.

Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00003=Really, Gary... I'm not making it up. That was me, your best buddy in the galaxy, Egon Stetmann!
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00004=Why do you always question me? I mean, look what I did with my mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00005=They're more than just metal zerg. I upgraded them with my own special blend of energy called... Egon-ergy!
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00006=Patent pending.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00007=When they're fully charged, they can do all sorts of nifty tricks.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00008=Take my mecha-baneling. Egon-ergy makes them harder to kill and more powerful.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00009=It can even give the little guys the ability to jump... That's right. Jumping banelings... what's more terrifying than that?

Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00017=I call them Stetmann Satellites... or, uhh... Ooh! What about Stetellites!
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00018=Think of them like a cross between zerg creep tumors and protoss pylons, except not as slimy or shiny.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00019=I can deploy them with the touch of a button, and they work best when they're linked together.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00020=The Stetellites generate their own, uhhh... "Stetzones.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00021=These are very important because they're the only way to recharge Egon-ergy.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00022=A healthy mecha-swarm is a happy mecha-swarm.

Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00029=Gary! Get back here! It's way too dangerous out there!
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00030=Hey. Hey. I didn't know you could overcharge the Stetellites like that.

Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00034=Now you can deploy your own Stetzone and keep the mecha-swarm enhanced on the go.
Conversation/acCutscene_Stetmann/Line00035=And if any of our little friends are destroyed in battle...

Conversation/acObj/Line00761=That's it, one last Void thrasher. Send that thing to hell.
Conversation/acObj/Line00762=Hell yeah, we made it. Tell you what, next time y'all are in town I'm buying the first round. And that's a promise. Haha!
Conversation/acObj/Line00768=Thank goodness you're here. Our research team has discovered that Amon is moving his troops across the sector via warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00769=The conduits cannot be destroyed, but the shuttles can. They must be stopped before they reach the warp conduits and escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line00770=Amon has activated the central warp conduit. Be prepared to prevent the shuttles from escaping.
Conversation/acObj/Line00771=Multiple shuttle launches bearing for the central warp conduit. Destroying them is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00772=The shuttles have been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00773=Focus on the shuttles! They've initiated warp protocol!
Conversation/acObj/Line00774=Scans confirm the shuttles' destruction.
Conversation/acObj/Line00777=One of the warp conduits is active again. Several waves of shuttles are converging on it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00778=The xel'naga shrines nearby are reacting to Amon's armies. Researching them may provide useful intel, but we will need an escort.
Conversation/acObj/Line00779=Dear god... The transport has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00780=Our research vessel is ready. We're moving out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line00781=Scan complete. Thank you for your help! They would have been lost without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line00782=We've lost contact with the research team.... They're gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line00783=No! The transport vessel... has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00784=We've gathered the data we need. Thank you for the escort, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00785=Our scans are finished. Science owes you a great debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00786=Research vessel ready. Let's get a team to that shrine.
Conversation/acObj/Line00787=Preparing a research vessel. Let's make this one count.
Conversation/acObj/Line00788=Void thrashers are starting to burn a hole through the fortress's ceiling. So, you know, that seems bad.
Conversation/acObj/Line00789=Hey! The fortress is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line00790=The shuttles will soon escape, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line00791=The shuttles have reached the conduit. They will soon warp away.
Conversation/acObj/Line00794=It appears that two warp conduits are active. Multiple waves of shuttles are in transit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00795=Another warp conduit has been activated. A wave of shuttles is headed toward it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00796=Two warp conduits are operating at once. A wave of shuttles is heading for each.
Conversation/acObj/Line00797=Ah, excellent. Our readings indicate three more waves of shuttles...
Conversation/acObj/Line00798=Only two waves of shuttles remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line00799=Prepare yourselves, commanders. The final wave of shuttles will be upon us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line00800=Shuttle heat signatures detected. They are launching many shuttles toward a single conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00802=They're sending all of the shuttles they have left. You must intercept them!
Conversation/acObj/Line00803=A well-deserved victory. The shuttles have been eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00804=A Void shard's been reported outside of your landing point, so that's your first objective. Best of luck out there.
Conversation/acObj/Line00805=This is Corporal Faraday of the Korhal Defense Force. Amon's troops have taken the city. They're summoning Void shards everywhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line00806=Several Void shards appearing on our sensors. Make sure you destroy all of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00807=Numerous Void shards detected. We need to destroy them ASAP.
Conversation/acObj/Line00808=Not good. Multiple Void shards in play. Your objective is to take them out.
Conversation/acObj/Line00809=The field is blowing up with these Void shards. We need to put them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00810=More Void shards are appearing. Destroying them is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00811=That's another Void shard down. 
Conversation/acObj/Line00812=Void shard eliminated. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00813=Good work on that Void shard.
Conversation/acObj/Line00814=Countdown's showing that Void shards are going to activate soon. That's not good.
Conversation/acObj/Line00815=Need to move against the Void shards soon. We're running out of time.
Conversation/acObj/Line00816=Time's almost up. We need to take out those Void shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00817=We don't have much time left. Destroy the Void shards while we still can!
Conversation/acObj/Line00818=Kimeran pirates are taking advantage of the chaos to steal precious resources. Shoot those traitors out of the sky, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line00819=Pirate ship neutralized. Nothing worse than pirates and traitors.
Conversation/acObj/Line00826=Things are almost back under control. This is the last group of Void shards. Let's take back our city.
Conversation/acObj/Line00827=Clock's ticking. We need to get rid of those shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line00828=Didn't come this far to just drop the ball now. Demolish those Void shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00831=Those filthy pirates are trying for another score. Let's lay down the law, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00832=Piracy in the skies above Korhal? Not on my watch.
Conversation/acObj/Line00833=That's all of the Void shards. The city is ours. You hear that, Amon? The Dominion is not so easily defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00836=The Zenith Stones near the temple have become unstable. It may be wise to dispose of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00837=Amon is assailing the temple with a Void thrasher. It has to be eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00838=A Void thrasher is bombarding the temple. You must end its assault.
Conversation/acObj/Line00839=Amon's forces are attacking the temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line00840=The temple is under attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line00841=Amon has dealt considerable damage to the temple thus far. Bolster our defenses, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00842=The temple has suffered significant damage. It cannot sustain much more.
Conversation/acObj/Line00843=The temple is nearly destroyed. Do not allow it to fall!
Conversation/acObj/Line00844=The Zenith Stones have been destroyed. Regrettable, but necessary.
Conversation/acObj/Line00845=The Zenith Stones are no more, and their volatile energies have been quelled.
Conversation/acObj/Line00846=It pains me to see the Zenith Stones destroyed, but it had to be done.
Conversation/acObj/Line00847=The temple has been primed. Its activation will eradicate Amon's remaining forces. Well done, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00848=Got a contract you might wanna help me fill. Amon's using Tarsonis's old train system to ship some questionable Moebius cargo.
Conversation/acObj/Line00849=En Taro Adun, commanders. Our forces are engaging Amon's minions across Shakuras. But the Dark God seeks this temple's demise.
Conversation/acObj/Line00850=Half of the temple's configurations are complete. Remain steadfast until it can activate.
Conversation/acObj/Line00851=The temple is beginning to awaken! It won't be long before it activates itself.
Conversation/acObj/Line00852=The temple is nearly operational. Stand firm, commanders! The battle is almost won!
Conversation/acObj/Line00853=Zerg drop pods detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00854=Detecting zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00855=Multiple thrashers have emerged from the Void. Dispatch them before they destroy the temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line00856=Several Void thrashers are besieging the temple. They must be annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00857=Looks like they've got another shipment leaving the station. Let's cause some delays.
Conversation/acObj/Line00858=Normally I'd encourage robbing a train like this. But with these guys... it's probably safer to light it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00859=Got another fast one on the bottom track. Better move if you wanna take it out.
Conversation/acObj/Line00860=They're sending two trains at once now. Must be getting desperate... or serious. Can't say I like the sound of either.
Conversation/acObj/Line00861=Those trains on the third rail are fast as hell. Gotta take them out quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line00862=Oh no... warp sequences completed. The shuttles have escaped.
Conversation/acObj/Line00863=The shuttles have warped away. They are beyond reach.
Conversation/acObj/Line00865=A troubling number of shuttles have eluded us. We cannot let this continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line00868=Too many shuttles... Commanders, you must not allow any others to escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line00869=Good job torchin' those trains. From the intel I've been provided, I'd say half their stock is in flames.
Conversation/acObj/Line00870=They can't have much cargo left. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line00871=They got one past us. Can't let that happen again. Got a reputation to maintain.
Conversation/acObj/Line00872=Hey, seriously. Those trains can't get through, or we'll have a lot more than a broken contract to worry about.
Conversation/acObj/Line00873=Two departures inbound. Time to step up your game.
Conversation/acObj/Line00878=And that's a done deal. Been a pleasure working with you.
Conversation/acObj/Line00879=I've been hired to destroy those trains, but I don't have the personnel to do it. I'm thinking maybe you do. What do you say?
Conversation/acObj/Line00880=Greetings, commanders. Amon seeks to destroy Ulnar by capturing its celestial locks and allowing their energies to overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line00881=Your objective is to activate all five locks. It will take units from both of your armies to do so. Work together, and prevail.
Conversation/acObj/Line00882=Amon's forces have seized a celestial lock. Taking control of it before it overloads is your primary objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line00883=Once they activate, those shards will decimate Augustgrad. We need to destroy each of them before that happens. Don't let me down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00884=Sure blows up pretty, doesn't it? The enemy'll summon more soon. Guaranteed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00885=First train's departing. Your objective is to destroy it before it escapes.
Conversation/acObj/Line00886=Got a train on that bottom track, moving fast. Must be a priority shipment. Intercept it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line00887=It will take time to activate the temple's power and repel his assault. Your objective is to defend it until that time comes.
Conversation/acObj/Line00888=Another Void thrasher is on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00889=Multiple Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00890=Void thrashers have been summoned.
Conversation/acObj/Line00891=Additional Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00892=Multiple Void thrashers detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00893=Void thrashers detected. Engagement advised.
Conversation/acObj/Line00894=A Void thrasher's death has been confirmed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00895=Void thrasher eliminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00896=A Void thrasher has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00897=Void thrasher neutralized.
Conversation/acObj/Line00898=Zerg drop pods detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00899=Detecting zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00902=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00903=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00904=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00905=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00906=What's my line again?
Conversation/acObj/Line00907=Multiple Void thrashers have appeared.
Conversation/acObj/Line00908=Several Void thrashers have been summoned.
Conversation/acObj/Line00909=Additional Void thrashers are now on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00910=Multiple Void thrashers detected.
Conversation/acObj/Line00911=Void thrashers detected. Engage them when ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line00912=A new Void thrasher has emerged on the battlefield.
Conversation/acObj/Line00913=A Void thrasher has been annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00914=Void thrasher obliterated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00915=We have slain a Void thrasher.
Conversation/acObj/Line00916=Void thrasher defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00917=Enemy zerg drop pods are inbound.
Conversation/acObj/Line00918=Incoming enemy zerg drop pods.
Conversation/acObj/Line00935=We have activated a celestial lock. It would be wise to defend it as we work to secure the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line00936=Another lock is now under our control.
Conversation/acObj/Line00937=We have secured another lock. Continue, and we will succeed in thwarting Amon's plan.
Conversation/acObj/Line00938=Another lock has now been activated.
Conversation/acObj/Line00939=A celestial lock has fallen into Amon's grasp. We must wrest control of it before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line00940=Amon has turned one of Ulnar's constructs to his will. If you can, destroy it and free it from its ill fate.
Conversation/acObj/Line00941=The construct is no more. The Dark God will not corrupt the xel'naga's works so easily.
Conversation/acObj/Line00942=The enemy is attempting to capture a celestial lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line00943=Amon's forces are moving to seize a celestial lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line00944=A celestial lock will soon be under enemy control.
Conversation/acObj/Line00945=Amon's minions have taken a lock in his name. This cannot go unanswered.
Conversation/acObj/Line00946=The enemy has seized a celestial lock. We must take it back.
Conversation/acObj/Line00947=The locks are halfway toward the point of overloading. We must activate all five of them to seal Ulnar's power reserves.
Conversation/acObj/Line00948=Ulnar speeds towards destruction. If we do not activate the locks soon, Ulnar will be obliterated!
Conversation/acObj/Line00949=The locks are nearly overloaded! We must activate them now, or we will all be destroyed in the explosion!
Conversation/acObj/Line00950=All five celestial locks have been activated. Amon will be unable to bypass them again. Well done, commanders. Ulnar is saved.
Conversation/acObj/Line00951=More rifts. Thrashers can't be far behind. Get ready torch 'em, would ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line00952=The rifts are opening! Won't be long before we gotta light up some thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line00953=Think I hear some Void thrashers knockin' on our door. Let's get ready to answer.
Conversation/acObj/Line00954=The shuttles are no more.
Conversation/acObj/Line00955=You have prevented the shuttles' escape.
Conversation/acObj/Line00956=Shuttles eliminated, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00957=A wave of shuttles has been shot down.
Conversation/acObj/Line00959=Shuttle warping is imminent. They must be stopped!
Conversation/acObj/Line00960=Hurry... the shuttles are about to warp away!
Conversation/acObj/Line00961=It seems we were unable to stop all of the shuttles before they warped away.
Conversation/acObj/Line00964=The shuttles have made it through the warp conduit. We have no way to track them.
Conversation/acObj/Line00965=One fewer Void shard for us to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line00966=It'll take more than a few Void shards to defeat the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line00967=Excellent work, commanders. That Void shard is toast.
Conversation/acObj/Line00968=You've neutralized another Void shard. Well done.
Conversation/acObj/Line00969=Another Void shard has been destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00970=They keep summoning shards, and we keep sending them back.
Conversation/acObj/Line00971=We have to break apart those shards before they activate. Get moving!
Conversation/acObj/Line00972=Running out of time, commanders! Tear down those shards!
Conversation/acObj/Line00973=The temple is under siege from a Void thrasher. Slay it before it deals too much damage.
Conversation/acObj/Line00974=Amon has summoned a Void thrasher. It will severely harm the temple for as long as it lives.
Conversation/acObj/Line00975=Amon has called forth numerous Void thrashers against us. Direct your forces accordingly.
Conversation/acObj/Line00976=It seems we will have to deal with more than one thrasher this time. Make haste, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line00977=Amon strikes against the temple. We must defend it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00978=Heads up. Another train's in transit.
Conversation/acObj/Line00979=You got a train to catch, commanders. Don't wanna miss it, do you?
Conversation/acObj/Line00980=They've loaded up another train. Make sure that cargo doesn't get delivered.
Conversation/acObj/Line00981=Incoming train. Do whatever it takes to derail it.
Conversation/acObj/Line00982=Here we go. Knock that train over and raise some hell.
Conversation/acObj/Line00983=Trains are leaving both stations at once. Guess they're trying to stay on schedule.
Conversation/acObj/Line00984=Damn! They've destroyed my fortress! We gotta get outta here, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line00985=The warp conduits are powering down... Amon must have warped all the troops he requires... who knows what they'll destroy now...
Conversation/acObj/Line00986=No! The shards are activating! Evacuate the city! We've lost Augustgrad!
Conversation/acObj/Line00987=By the gods... the temple! It's... Commanders, the battle is lost. The temple is destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00988=I'm not used to jobs going south like this. Pack it up, commanders. Show's over.
Conversation/acObj/Line00989=A few shuttles have managed to warp off-planet. We must ensure that the remaining shuttles do not.
Conversation/acObj/Line00990=Scans indicate that not every shuttle in that wave was destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line00991=Hm. It seems that at least a portion of that wave was able to escape.
Conversation/acObj/Line00992=Residual warp energy detected. Some of the shuttles must have made it through.
Conversation/acObj/Line00993=We're picking up outbound warp signatures. Some shuttles must have escaped.
Conversation/acObj/Line00996=The research vessel is reporting incoming enemy forces. Commanders, they need your help!
Conversation/acObj/Line00997=Hostile elements are en route the to the research vessel. They require your protection!
Conversation/acObj/Line00998=Mayday! The research vessel is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line00999=The enemy is attacking our research vessel! Those scientists are defenseless!
Conversation/acObj/Line01000=Well, speak of the devil. Looks like one of those thrashers is about to come around.
Conversation/acObj/Line01001=All right, time to punch in! Your objective is to knock down that thrasher.
Conversation/acObj/Line01002=Got some intel that says we got two groups of thrashers left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01003=That's the last group of thrashers! Take 'em out, and we're home free!
Conversation/acObj/Line01004=Now that was a fight! Just gotta do it three more times, is all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01005=Two thrashers left! Let's show 'em how to tango.
Conversation/acObj/Line01006=Last thrasher! Make that one pay for scratchin' up my paint job!
Conversation/acObj/Line01007=Moebius has an Archangel!? I've been tryin'a get one myself for years! Listen, if you can, do me a favor. Torch that thing so I can rebuild it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01008=Woo! I have got to get me one of those!
Conversation/acObj/Line01009=All that, just to high tail it outta here? Moebius Corps oughta be ashamed of themselves!
Conversation/acObj/Line01010=My fortress is takin' some serious hits. Clear out those thrashers before it gets too hot too handle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01011=My fortress can't take much more punishment. You gotta do somethin' about those thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line01012=The fortress's about to collapse! A few more hits and we're done for!
Conversation/acObj/Line01013=Fortress is comin' down! We gotta abandon it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01014=Couldn't have done it better myself, commanders. Woo! You ever have need of a tank jockey, I'm your gal. (laughs)
Conversation/acObj/Line01015=Right on time, commanders! These Void thrashers are tearin' up my base and they ain't gonna let up anytime soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01017=They got my men pinned down, so it's up to you to stop 'em. Nix those thrashers fast, before they blast my fortress apart!
Conversation/acObj/Line01018=Man, am I glad to see the two of you! My base is gettin' slammed by these Void thrashers, and it can't take much more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01019=I'm too busy fightin' fires in here to handle 'em myself. You gotta destroy those thrashers before they destroy this fortress!
Conversation/acObj/Line01020=See that rift over yonder? That's how a thrasher appears on the battlefield. Get ready to welcome it, would ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line01021=There's the first thrasher! Main objective is to kill it, and fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01022=I'm hearin' that there should only be two groups of thrashers left. Get ready to take 'em out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01023=Almost there, commanders! This is the last group of thrashers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01024=Looks like there are three thrashers left. Time to drop that down to zero!
Conversation/acObj/Line01025=Just two to go. Dust 'em, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01026=This is it! The last thrasher! Let's end this thing.
Conversation/acObj/Line01027=<Low whistle> Would ya look at that? An Archangel! Probably a good idea to destroy it before they can use it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01028=That's it? Thought that thing would put up more of a fight!
Conversation/acObj/Line01029=Ah hell, it got away! Guess we just didn't have the firepower to take it down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01030=That's the last of 'em! With the Void thrashers gone, my boys can handle the rest. Thank ya kindly, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01031=Greetings, commanders. My fellow scientists have determined that Amon is using Kaldir as a staging ground for his troop shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01032=The warp conduits he uses cannot be attacked, so you will need to destroy the shuttles themselves before they can warp away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01033=Thank you for responding to our call. It seems Amon is using Kaldir's warp conduits to transport his troops across the sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line01034=You won't be able to destroy the warp conduits, but you can destroy the shuttles. You must do so before they leave the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01035=The central warp conduit is active. Amon will surely attempt to send his shuttles through it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01036=The central warp conduit is now online. It won't be long before Amon's shuttles depart for it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01037=Several shuttles are en route to the central warp conduit. Your objective is to eliminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01038=We've located your main objective. You must destroy the shuttles headed for the central conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01039=Another wave of shuttles is headed for a warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01040=We're detecting your main objective, a wave of shuttles inbound on an active conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01041=A wave of shuttles is making its way to an active warp conduit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01042=A warp conduit is powering up, and a wave of shuttles is bearing toward it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01043=Detecting two active warp conduits. They both have shuttles inbound on their positions.
Conversation/acObj/Line01044=Two warp conduits have come online. Your objective is to stop both waves of shuttles from escaping.
Conversation/acObj/Line01045=It seems they are focusing all of their shuttles on a single warp conduit this time. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01046=Only one warp conduit this time, but it has a large number of incoming shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01047=All shuttles are en route to a single warp conduit. Your objective is to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01048=They appear to be launching more shuttles toward the warp conduits.
Conversation/acObj/Line01049=All of their remaining shuttles are inbound! They must be stopped!
Conversation/acObj/Line01050=We're reading multiple signatures in flight. They're sending all the shuttles they have left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01051=According to our scans, three waves of shuttles remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01052=From what we've gathered, I'd say they have three waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01053=By my calculations, there are two waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01054=There should only be two waves of shuttles left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01055=I believe we have eliminated all but the final wave of shuttles.
Conversation/acObj/Line01056=These readings suggest that only one wave of shuttles remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01057=Some shuttles have slipped past our blockade, commanders. Take care not to let others do the same.
Conversation/acObj/Line01058=Despite our efforts, a few shuttles have escaped. We cannot not allow others to pass.
Conversation/acObj/Line01059=Quite a few shuttles have warped away. If this continues, our efforts will be for naught.
Conversation/acObj/Line01060=The number of escaped shuttles is alarming. Commanders, the line must be held.
Conversation/acObj/Line01061=If any more shuttles warp away, then our actions will be futile!
Conversation/acObj/Line01062=This isn't good... we must destroy these shuttles at all costs, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01063=Kaldir's xel'naga shrines may contain invaluable knowledge. My team is setting out to scan them, but they will require protection.
Conversation/acObj/Line01064=Amon has taken an interest in some nearby xel'naga shrines. Our researchers will investigate, but they will need to be guarded.
Conversation/acObj/Line01065=Our scientists are detecting an inbound enemy presence. Please safeguard them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01066=Our scientists are under attack! They'll never survive without help!
Conversation/acObj/Line01067=It seems they've sent all the shuttles they need. We did our best, but it seems Amon's armies will grow stronger nonetheless.
Conversation/acObj/Line01068=You've succeeded in thwarting Amon's plan! Our research facility -- and the sector -- owe you a great debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01069=Amon has no more shuttles to send. Now he will be unable to reinforce his armies. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01070=Corporal Faraday reporting in with a sitrep, commanders. Amon's forces are summoning Void shards all across the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01071=We're looking at total devastation if they're allowed to activate. I need you to take down those shards while there's still time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01072=Corporal Faraday here. We're in it deep, commanders. Amon's summoning Void shards in multiple locations around the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01073=Their activation will result in the city's destruction and catastrophic civilian casualties. We need to destroy those shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line01074=Scanner's picking up a Void shard near your location. Your objective is to take it out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01075=Sending you the location of your main objective. Now that Void shard needs to be destroyed posthaste, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01076=And that's how it's done. Good work. Just gotta do the same to the rest of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01077=That's just the first of many. Okay, commanders. Let's get to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01078=Only one group of shards left. Crush them into dust and end this fight.
Conversation/acObj/Line01079=Home stretch, commanders. One more group of shards to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01080=Those Kimeran pirates are trying to steal from us during an attack on the city. I'd appreciate it if you could exterminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01081=That pirate scum ransacks the city at a time like this? I know it's a personal request, but if you can... please kill them all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01082=These pirates just don't learn, do they? Commanders, it's time to educate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01083=These wretched pirates are about to get a helluva lot more than they bargained for. Take them out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01084=That's the thing about the Dominion. Even in a crisis, our rule of law holds firm.
Conversation/acObj/Line01085=Damn it, we're out of time! Pull back, commanders. We have to get everyone out of the city!
Conversation/acObj/Line01086=Korhal is in your debt, commanders. You've saved a lot of lives today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01087=I bet Amon didn't count on the two of you joining the fray. Way to make him regret it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01088=The war against Amon rages, commanders. His forces descend upon this xel'naga temple as we speak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01089=It has yet to fall, but it will not last long. Your objective is to defend it until its activation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01090=Thank the gods you are here, commanders. We do not have much time before Amon assails this temple.
Conversation/acObj/Line01091=Its activation has begun, but it needs more time to be completed. Defending the temple until then is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01092=Amon's assault on the temple is beginning to take its toll. We must be vigilant in its defense.
Conversation/acObj/Line01093=Beware, commanders! Amon's forces have severely damaged the temple. We must fight to protect it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01094=Amon has nearly destroyed the temple! We must prevent him from succeeding!
Conversation/acObj/Line01095=The temple is halfway toward activation. Maintain our defenses, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01096=The temple's preparations are proceeding as planned. Stay strong in your defense.
Conversation/acObj/Line01097=Excellent, the temple's mechanisms are aligning properly. It will soon be ready for activation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01098=Our defenses are proving effective. Soon the temple will be ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line01099=Preparations are nearly complete, commanders! Defend the temple for just a few more moments!
Conversation/acObj/Line01100=The temple's activation is nigh. Continue our defenses, commanders! It is almost time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01101=The temple's Zenith Stones are reacting to our actions. I suggest demolishing them for safety's sake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01102=It seems the nearby Zenith Stones are becoming volatile. It is unfortunate, but it may be prudent for us to destroy them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01103=Only one of the unstable Zenith Stones remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01104=We have eliminated all but one of the volatile Zenith Stones.
Conversation/acObj/Line01105=There remains one last Zenith Stone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01106=Abandon our defenses, commanders. The temple is lost. Amon has won this battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01107=The temple is ready for activation. Well fought, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01108=Preparations are complete. Our defenses have held and the temple stands ready. Victory is ours, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01109=Glad you're here. Need a little help fulfilling a contract. Amon's shipping some nasty tech onboard these trains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01110=My job is to torch 'em, but my guys are late to the party. Now, I'm thinking you'd like to see those trains go up in smoke, too.
Conversation/acObj/Line01111=Fancy seeing you here. Guess it's my lucky day. Dominion's hired me to destroy some trains carrying dangerous Moebius ordnance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01112=Seeing as how Amon's a mutual enemy, maybe you'd like to step up to the plate. I could use a partner or two on this.
Conversation/acObj/Line01113=One of the trains is leaving its station now. Destroying it is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01114=Got eyes on your objective. Blow up that train before it reaches its destination.
Conversation/acObj/Line01115=There's a train booking it on the bottom track. If you wanna catch it, you're gonna have to move fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01116=Trains on that bottom track are faster than the others. You can try and stop 'em, but you gotta be quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line01117=Trains are departing from both stations. Gotta move fast to hit them both.
Conversation/acObj/Line01118=Got a pair of trains, one from each station. Better step on it, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01119=Two trains, leaving simultaneously. Looks like your dance card's full.
Conversation/acObj/Line01120=Contract offers a big bonus for hitting the trains on the third rail. But don't do it for me, do it for the good of the sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line01121=Client's willing to pay extra if you take out the trains on the bottom track. You take 'em out, Amon's mad and I'm happy. Win-win.
Conversation/acObj/Line01122=We've taken out about half of their trains. Nice work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01123=Looks like we're making good progress. We've knocked over roughly half of their shipments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01124=I reckon they're running out of hardware to ship. Almost got 'em, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01125=Their warehouses should be looking real empty right now. Not too many trains left to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01126=One of their trains got through. That cargo is bad news for everyone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01127=Damn, they managed to get a train into station. We can't let them do that again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01128=That's two trains that've gotten past us. Don't let another one by, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01129=This is bad. We fail to stop one more shipment, and this entire op is as burned out as Chau Sara.
Conversation/acObj/Line01130=That's all she wrote, commanders. They've delivered enough hardware that anything we do now is wasted effort.
Conversation/acObj/Line01131=That was some impressive work, commanders. You ever want to get into the merc business, gimme a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line01132=Another contract fulfilled. You got my thanks, commanders. But not my cut. <Laughs>
Conversation/acObj/Line01133=A celestial lock is under Amon's control. Your objective is to reclaim it before it overloads.
Conversation/acObj/Line01134=Amon's followers have taken control of a celestial lock. It is your objective to take it back before it overloads.
Conversation/acObj/Line01135=We have laid claim to one of the celestial locks. We must hold it until the others are ours, as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01136=We must activate all five locks in order to stop him. Units from both of your armies must be present to complete your objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01137=You arrived just in time, commanders. Amon is attempting to destroy Ulnar by overloading its celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01138=Our plans to enter the Void are in jeopardy. Amon intends to destroy Ulnar by overloading its celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01139=Activating all five locks is your objective. Units from both of your armies must stand together near a lock to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01140=A lock has been activated. We must endeavor to keep it that way.
Conversation/acObj/Line01141=We are one step closer to regaining full control of the celestial locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01142=Each lock we activate slows Amon's progress. We must continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line01143=We have activated another lock. Press on, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01145=We have activated four of the locks. We need only do the same to the fifth.
Conversation/acObj/Line01146=That is the fourth lock under our control. Once we activate the final one, Amon will be defeated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01147=Our foe has captured one of the locks. Reclaiming it is your main objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01148=Amon's forces have taken control of a celestial lock. Your primary objective is to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01149=Amon's minions are contesting a lock. They will soon gain control of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01150=We cannot allow Amon's army to take control of this lock.
Conversation/acObj/Line01151=A xel'naga construct has been corrupted by Amon's Void energies. It would be an act of mercy to destroy it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01152=It seems Amon has gained control of a xel'naga construct. This is sacrilege, commanders. Destroy it if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01153=You have destroyed the construct. Amon can no longer use it against us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01154=Amon has lost his defiled construct. Exemplary work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01155=Amon's forces have brought Ulnar halfway towards its destruction. We must hurry to activate the locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01156=Half of Ulnar's energies have become volatile and unstable. The locks must be activated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01157=The energies within Ulnar are raging against each other. You must activate the locks, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01158=Amon has destabilized the majority of Ulnar's power. We must activate the locks before it's too late!
Conversation/acObj/Line01159=Amon is dangerously close to destroying Ulnar! You must activate the locks at once!
Conversation/acObj/Line01160=We must not allow Ulnar to be obliterated! Activate the locks while there's still time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01161=Ulnar... the cradle of life... we could not save it from Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01162=Without Ulnar, we cannot enter the Void... and Amon will be free to regain his strength uncontested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01163=Once again, Amon's minions fall before our conviction. Now to open the gate to the Void, and end him once and for all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01164=The locks are in place and Ulnar's energies have been stabilized. We can now use the temple to enter the Void and put an end to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01165=Amon's forces are moving upon a celestial lock. If they gain control of it, the lock will begin to overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01166=A celestial lock is being claimed by Amon. If left uncontested, it will fall under his control and begin to destabilize Ulnar.
Conversation/acObj/Line01167=Amon's army is attempting to secure a celestial lock. It will begin to overload if they succeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01168=Three of the locks are now ours. We must secure the remaining two.
Conversation/acObj/Line01169=Three locks have been activated. If we secure the two that are left, we will have saved Ulnar.
Conversation/acObj/Line01170=We have managed to reclaim three of the five locks. Two more, and our battle is won.
Conversation/acObj/Line01171=Four of the five locks are under our control. Only one remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01178=Amon has activated all three warp conduits! Hurry, commanders! We must stop the shuttles!
Conversation/acObj/Line01179=All three warp conduits are active! We must make haste to prevent their escape!
Conversation/acObj/Line01180=Shuttles are on course for all three conduits! We will have to split our forces to stop them all!
Conversation/acObj/Line01181=Damn pirates! If we weren't busy defending the city, they'd be a burning wreckage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01182=Don't sweat it, commanders. Concentrate on saving the city. I'll hunt down that scum later.
Conversation/acObj/Line01183=They got away, huh? Once we're done here, I'll see to them personally.
Conversation/acObj/Line01184=Nothing I hate more than pirates. They got away today, but they won't evade me forever.
Conversation/acObj/Line01185=Let those cowards run, commanders. We'll get 'em next time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01186=Here come the thrashers, commanders! Let's light 'em up!
Conversation/acObj/Line01187=Lock and load! It's time to clear out some thrashers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01188=The Void thrashers are on the field! Take 'em out, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01189=There's your objective, commanders. Show those thrashers who's boss!
Conversation/acObj/Line01190=Looks like the thrashers have arrived. Let's kick 'em back to the Void!
Conversation/acObj/Line01191=Your objective is to activate all five locks. You must place units from your army within the lock's vicinity to do so.
Conversation/acObj/Line01192=We must activate all five locks in order to stop him. Units from your army must be near a lock to complete your objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01193=Activating all five locks is your objective. Units from your army must stand near a lock to activate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01194=Heads up, commanders! That Archangel is on the move. Probably gonna start repairing itself 'til it's under fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01195=Looks like that Archangel is makin' a break for it. I reckon it'll try repairing itself 'til you engage it again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01196=That Archangel's tryin' for some evasive maneuvers. My money's on it repairing itself 'til you start shootin' at it again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01197=Archangel's makin' a tactical retreat. Most likely to repair itself. Sooner you attack it, sooner those repairs will stop.
Conversation/acObj/Line01198=Well fought, commanders. Two Zentith Stones remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01199=You have successfully shattered a Zenith Stone. Two more await you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01200=Your conviction is admirable, commanders. We have two more Zenith Stones to address.
Conversation/acObj/Line01201=Scanners are picking up multiple Void shards. Our mission is to obliterate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01202=Multiple Void shards are active on the field. Eliminate them with extreme prejudice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01203=No rest for the righteous. Looks like we've got another set of Void shards to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01204=Don't get too cozy, commanders. More Void shards have appeared and our time is short.
Conversation/acObj/Line01205=Detecting newly summoned Void shards. It's our job to blast them apart.
Conversation/acObj/Line01206=Look alive, commanders. It won't be long before that Void shard decimates the city.
Conversation/acObj/Line01207=Not long until Void shard activation. You have to destroy that shard before then.
Conversation/acObj/Line01208=Keep an eye on the clock, commanders. Don't let it run out before you destroy that Void shard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01209=We need to get moving! That Void shard's gonna activate soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01210=We're almost out of time! That Void shard has to be destroyed immediately!
Conversation/acObj/Line01211=Time is not on our side, commanders! Eliminate that Void shard while you still can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01212=Now that's what I like to see. Void shard terminated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01213=I see your reputations are well earned. These Void shards are dropping like flies.
Conversation/acObj/Line01214=And another Void shard crumbles into dust. Well done, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01215=Not today, Amon. We'll obliterate every Void shard you stick in the ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01216=Looks like you've nixed another Void shard, commanders. I'm impressed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01217=It's been a tough fight, but there should only be one group of Void thrashers left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01218=Sounds like we've busted up all but the last group of thrashers.
Conversation/acObj/Line01219=Only one group of thrashers left, commanders. We can do this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01220=Amon's forces now control multiple locks. The more they control, the faster they will overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01221=Our enemies have seized a number of locks. The overloading process hastens with each lock they control.
Conversation/acObj/Line01222=We must activate the locks as soon as possible. The more Amon controls, the faster they all overload.
Conversation/acObj/Line01223=Each lock Amon's army controls quickens the overloading. It is imperative that we take back the locks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01224=The locks are overloading at an increasing rate, now that Amon holds more than one. Activate the locks quickly, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01225=I am Ji'nara, First Ascendant of the Tal'darim. One of Amon's remaining loyalists has dared to challenge me to Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01226=He seeks to climb the Chain and become Highlord. Keep your armies close to me. With their psionic support, I will end his ascent.
Conversation/acObj/Line01227=The rite of Rak'Shir will soon begin. Amon's loyalists seek to regain control of the Tal'darim by climbing the Chain of Ascension.
Conversation/acObj/Line01228=As First Ascendant, I will exterminate these traitors. Both of your armies must stand with me to provide their psionic support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01229=I am First Ascendant Ji'nara, and I have been challenged to Rak'Shir by a faction of Tal'darim who foolishly remain loyal to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01230=The Dark God bolsters their champion's strength. Send both of your armies to my side to bolster mine. I will emerge victorious.
Conversation/acObj/Line01231=Both of you must support me. Send your armies to me at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01232=You must position both of your armies nearby in order to support me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01233=Only one army? That is not enough! Both of your armies must stand near me to offer their support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01234=I thought there were two of you in this fight. I expect support from both. Send your armies to my side.
Conversation/acObj/Line01235=Both of your armies must support me, commanders. No half measures. Move them near me at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01236=Yes, your power courses through me. Soon, Amon's champion will fall into the abyss.
Conversation/acObj/Line01237=The power you offer me will be the end of these fools. Maintaining this support is your primary objective.
Conversation/acObj/Line01238=Now that I have your support, I can slay this traitorous filth.
Conversation/acObj/Line01239=Excellent. With your assistance, I will put an end to this reckless insubordination.
Conversation/acObj/Line01240=The support from your armies will prove useful. Your objective is to continue providing it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01241=Amon sends reinforcements to support his champion. Prepare to meet them in combat.
Conversation/acObj/Line01242=It seems Amon's lackeys are moving toward their champion. Intercept them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01243=The enemy is sending forces to support their champion. Match their strength.
Conversation/acObj/Line01244=Enemy supplicants are headed toward their champion. Kill them all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01245=A group of enemies seeks to support Amon's champion. Do not allow that to happen.
Conversation/acObj/Line01246=Amon's champion draws power from his supplicants. Eliminate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01247=Enemy forces are supporting their champion psionically. They must be destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01248=The enemy is providing their champion with psionic support. You must deny him their aid.
Conversation/acObj/Line01249=These traitors are seething with Amon's power. Slay them so they cannot support their champion.
Conversation/acObj/Line01250=Amon's worshipers are augmenting their champion's power. Do not allow this to continue.
Conversation/acObj/Line01251=You have slain the enemy champion's supplicants and taken away his support. Admirable brutality.
Conversation/acObj/Line01252=The enemy's supplicants have been annihilated. Such is the fate of all who kneel to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01253=What fools, to think they can seize control of the Tal'darim. When Alarak's rule ends, it will be my doing, and mine alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01254=The Tal'darim will not fall back into Amon's grasp. These traitors will be cut from the chain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01255=Ascension is only for the worthy. Amon's pitiful lackeys hardly qualify.
Conversation/acObj/Line01256=Your armies have been routed. You must replace them without delay, before I lose too much ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01257=Amon's forces have eradicated your armies and taken away my support. Provide me with more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01258=Is this the best your armies can offer? The enemy has torn them apart. Send more to my side immediately.
Conversation/acObj/Line01259=These losses are unacceptable. You must not allow Amon's champion to remain uncontested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01260=You have underestimated Amon's strength. Do not do so again. Commit additional forces at once.
Conversation/acObj/Line01261=You must send your armies to support me so I can decimate this rebellion.
Conversation/acObj/Line01262=I require supplicants if I am to quell this uprising. Do not delay in sending me your armies.
Conversation/acObj/Line01263=Position both of your armies nearby to grant me power. I will need them in order to win Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01264=I will not allow Amon's champion to prevail. Send your armies to me at once!
Conversation/acObj/Line01265=I did not call upon you for idle chatter. The psionic support from your armies is the key to my victory. Move them near me now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01266=Amon's champion is losing ground. It won't be long before he falls to his doom.
Conversation/acObj/Line01267=Your support is proving effective. The enemy champion cannot hope to overcome it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01268=I am overwhelming the enemy champion. Continue to pledge your power to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01269=These rebels have an entrenched position up ahead. You must destroy their encampment if I am to end this farce.
Conversation/acObj/Line01270=It seems the enemy has established fortifications on the path to the pit. Be prepared to set them ablaze.
Conversation/acObj/Line01271=An enemy base stands in the way of my victory. Tear it down and grind the rubble into dust.
Conversation/acObj/Line01272=Oblivion awaits Amon's minions. Maintain your psionic support and I shall deliver them unto it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01273=The hour is nearly at hand. Keep your armies close to me, so that I might strike the killing blow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01274=It is time to conclude this duel. Give me your power. I will rip Amon's champion apart.
Conversation/acObj/Line01275=I am losing ground. Send me support immediately, unless you wish to lose the Tal'darim to Amon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01276=Amon grants his champion unnatural strength. I must siphon power from your armies if I am to regain the ground I have lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01277=You have allowed Amon's champion to gain considerable ground. Correct this error!
Conversation/acObj/Line01278=I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. Push back against Amon's champion soon, or lose the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01279=Amon's champion has advanced within sight of the pit. This cannot stand! Match his strength before he succeeds!
Conversation/acObj/Line01280=Are you here to aid me in this rite or not? I have nearly fallen back to the pit!
Conversation/acObj/Line01281=Support me with your armies now, or I will cross the edge of the pit! 
Conversation/acObj/Line01282=Send your armies to me immediately! All is nearly lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line01283=Amon's champion is moments away from victory! If I am thrown into that pit, I am taking you with me!
Conversation/acObj/Line01284=The elementals of Slayn may interfere with Rak'Shir if they wander too close to us. Slaughter them, if possible.
Conversation/acObj/Line01285=I sense several elementals nearby. Their psionic bleating is distracting me. Silence them, if you have the forces to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line01286=These lumbering elementals have always irritated me. Wipe them out, if your armies are strong enough to be divided.
Conversation/acObj/Line01287=I see you have slain one of the elementals. Two more remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line01288=These elementals have always been a nuisance. Exterminate the remaining two.
Conversation/acObj/Line01289=The first beast is dead. Kill the other two as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01290=The elemental has encased one of your warriors in a cocoon. I suggest you break them out before they are devoured.
Conversation/acObj/Line01291=One of your warriors seems to have been encased in the elemental's cocoon. Will you break them out, or leave them to die?
Conversation/acObj/Line01292=How amusing. One of your warriors is trapped in the elemental's cocoon. How long can they survive without you breaking them out?
Conversation/acObj/Line01293=Another elemental vanquished. Only one remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01294=Two elementals have met their demise. See to it that the third one joins them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01295=Such troublesome creatures. Slay the last one when you have the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01296=All of the elementals have been eradicated. Now return your full attention to Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01297=One day, I will render those elementals extinct. But for now, let us focus our efforts on the task at hand.
Conversation/acObj/Line01298=You have destroyed all of the elementals in the surrounding area. Your penchant for violence is impressive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01299=No! This cannot be! I am the First Ascendant! I...
Conversation/acObj/Line01300=You have doomed the Tal'darim, commanders! I will haunt you for all eternity! Do you hear me!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01301=And so ends Rak'Shir. What a pathetic display. When the day comes, I hope Alarak proves to be a more fitting challenge.
Conversation/acObj/Line01302=Victory is mine. You make for effective supplicants, commanders. I will remember that when I challenge Alarak to Rak'shir myself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01303=Let this be a lesson to all who dare to challenge me. Commanders, I commend your strength in battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01304=Highlord, Amon's followers linger within our ranks. Their champion has challenged me to Rak'shir in order to usurp the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01305=This insubordination must be punished. I will require psionic support from both your supplicants as well as your partner's army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01306=Highlord Alarak. An ascendant who remains loyal to Amon has challenged me to Rak'shir. We must stand together to crush him.
Conversation/acObj/Line01307=Psionic support from both you and your ally would make me unbeatable. Declare for me, and we will obliterate this traitor.
Conversation/acObj/Line01308=The Tal'darim are at odds with each other, Highlord. A faction of Amon worshipers seeks to stage a coup via the rite of Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01309=We both know this cannot stand. I must win this challenge, and to do that I need both you and your ally to support me psionically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01310=It will take more than one army's power for me to overcome this challenger, Highlord. You must both commit your forces to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01311=Is there some reason only one army is offering me support? If you allow me to fail here, they will challenge you next, Highlord.
Conversation/acObj/Line01312=Without support from both armies, I will be unable to defeat this challenger. It's in your interest to assure my victory, Alarak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01313=Despite your confidence in my abilities, I must remind you that I require psionic support from both armies in order to win.
Conversation/acObj/Line01314=Alarak, you know better than anyone the importance of psionic support when challenged to Rak'shir. Both armies must provide it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01330=I see your blades have not dulled since becoming Highlord. I will remember that.
Conversation/acObj/Line01331=Your battlefield tactics are impressive, Alarak. I have ascertained much from observing them. Much indeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01332=You've broken the enemy's support. It cost you a few warriors, but no doubt you'll manage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01333=The enemy has made a grievous error. Their champion has lost his support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01334=A bold stratagem, Alarak. Brutally efficient at eliminating the enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01335=Amon's forces have wiped out your army, Highlord. Remember that the Chain of Ascension is only as strong as its weakest link.
Conversation/acObj/Line01336=I know this is not the full extent of your power, Alarak. Send me your best if you wish to maintain order within the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01337=It seems you've underestimated your opponent. I will keep that tendency in mind. But for now, I require reinforcements.
Conversation/acObj/Line01338=Your warriors have faltered, Alarak. I do pray this is not a common occurrence. Devote more of them to my support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01339=Has your strength waned since your ascension? Or are you trying to eliminate me as well? Win this fight, or lose the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01340=I did not inform you of this challenge so you could spectate, Alarak. I require psionic support from your army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01341=Highlord, I must be victorious if you are to keep hold of the Tal'darim. Send your forces to support me without delay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01342=Now is not the time to test my strength. Pledge your forces to my cause before it is too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line01343=You know how this works, Alarak. I need supplicants in order to win this challenge. Send them to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01344=Need I remind you that your objective is to support me? If you wish to see me thrown into the pit, then do it yourself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01354=I am losing ground, Highlord. You and your ally must support me, unless you wish your command to be usurped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01355=I expected more from you than this, Alarak. Are you intentionally holding back? Send me support so I can regain lost ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01356=The tide turns against me, Highlord. If you do not intervene with additional support, it will erode your rule as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01357=Highlord, I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. You must support me now, or Amon will be poised to conquer the Tal'darim anew!
Conversation/acObj/Line01358=I am within sight of the pit, Alarak. Support me now! I must not be defeated here! 
Conversation/acObj/Line01359=Is this the best the mighty Alarak can muster? If I lose here, the entire chain will belong to Amon once again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01360=Was Artanis's support during your own Rak'shir this ineffective? Do something, before Amon's champion wins!
Conversation/acObj/Line01361=I am inches away from the pit! What are you playing at, Alarak? Do you want this insurrection to succeed? 
Conversation/acObj/Line01362=Aid me now, Highlord, or forfeit the Tal'darim to Amon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01378=Curse you, Alarak! Was this your plan all along? You have doomed us all, you fool! Amon will come for you next!
Conversation/acObj/Line01379=You have failed, Highlord! All those incessant machinations, and for what? You have lost the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01380=Your rule of the Tal'darim holds for another day, Highlord. It seems the time for leadership to change is not yet upon us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01381=An impressive display, Alarak. Fear not, I have no intention of challenging you myself. Today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01382=My gratitude for your declaration in my favor, Highlord. It was... enlightening to see your tactics in practice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01383=Amon's hybrids are greatly enhancing his champion's strength. They must be eliminated immediately!
Conversation/acObj/Line01384=These hybrids possess immense psionic power. Destroy them, or that power will belong to their champion!
Conversation/acObj/Line01385=Massive psionic power flows into Amon's champion from the hybrids. Slay them quickly!
Conversation/acObj/Line01386=Psionic support from the hybrids turns the tide in Amon's favor. Put an end to it, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line01387=Hybrids... I cannot stand against them for long. Kill them before I am overwhelmed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01388=The elemental will not linger here for long. Do not tarry if you wish to destroy it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01389=I can sense the elemental's unrest. Slay it before it scurries away to breed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01390=The elemental will soon depart. I shall be glad to be rid of it, but I would prefer you kill it instead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01391=It won't be long before that elemental leaves this place. I'd like to see it torn apart before that happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line01392=You don't have long before the elemental escapes. Exterminate that pest before it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line01393=It seems the elemental has slipped through your fingers. A shame.
Conversation/acObj/Line01394=That elemental remains free to roam Slayn. No matter. Its death is inevitable. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01395=So, you were unable to slay the elemental. I will deal with it myself after Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01396=Is there no end to this elemental vermin? Crush this one if you can spare the warriors to do so.
Conversation/acObj/Line01397=Yet another elemental has wandered onto the field of battle. Deal with it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01398=I hate these detestable elementals. Eliminate them if you have the strength to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line01401=This is Donny Vermillion live in orbit around Veridia Prime: a once beautiful resort, now under assault by nefarious forces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01402=The plan is to have workers gather xenon crystals to restore the environmental stabilizer. But is that the whole story?
Conversation/acObj/Line01403=And we're back, live in orbit around Veridia Prime. Emperor Valerian's allies have finally arrived, but is it already too late?
Conversation/acObj/Line01404=The plan is for workers to gather xenon crystals to reactivate the stabilizer. Will it work? This reporter can only guess, no.
Conversation/acObj/Line01405=The resort world of Veridia was once a jewel in the Dominion's crown. Today, that jewel has cracked, metaphorically, AND by lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01406=The planet's only hope? Two commanders, whose workers must refuel the stabilizer. Let's join the mission already in progress.
Conversation/acObj/Line01407=Earlier an unknown enemy technology destabilized Veridia's core, resulting in endless waves of lava. Another is on its way now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01409=The lava is rising! Let's hope the forces down there can reach high ground safely. (aside)Or not. We could use the ratings.
Conversation/acObj/Line01410=This report from Terry, our seismologist, who says seismic activity is increasing. That means lava. And it's coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01411=Here's the lava! Watch the low ground viewers, that's where the action is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01412=The commanders' workers should collect the crystals and bring them to the stabilizer soon. We'll be here when they begin!
Conversation/acObj/Line01414=This just in, the environmental stabilizer is at 25% and holding. Still a long way to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01415=The stabilizer has reached the halfway point. But it's still too early for celebration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01416=The stabilizer is 75% percent charged. So close, yet so far. Will they pull through?
Conversation/acObj/Line01418=Four minutes until Veridia's cataclysmic end. They can't hear me, but I'm sure the commanders know the pressure is on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01419=Two minutes left. The air in the studio is so thick (faking it)I can barely speak, (faking it harder)but I will... (back to normal)for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01420=Only one minute left! They need to be loading crystals like there's no tomorrow. Because there might not be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01421=Three minutes left. You can feel the tension is building.
Conversation/acObj/Line01422=Breaking news! A Molten Salamander the locals call "Molten Sal" has been drawn to the scene. It could create unimaginable chaos!
Conversation/acObj/Line01423=It looks like the Salamander has resurfaced. If the commanders are going to do something, now just might be the time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01424=This just in, Dominion allies slay an endangered animal. Was there really no other way?
Conversation/acObj/Line01425=A crushing defeat, and in my humble opinion, the blame falls squarely upon Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01426=(surprised)The Dominion's allies are victorious... (recovering)But was plundering Veridia's natural resources worth it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01427=Air units caught within a deadly lava spout. I can't see the damage, but if I were to guess? Total devastation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01428=The commanders need to be careful. Spouts of magma can reach into the upper stratosphere, even taking out spacecraft!
Conversation/acObj/Line01429=As quickly as it surges, the lava recedes. Now it's up to the workers to reach those new crystal formations in time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01430=They won? Cut the feed... I can't use this! What do you mean we're still live?
Conversation/acObj/Line01431=A great victory. Thanks to your intrepid reporter, Donny Vermillion. (aside)Bet I get a Sammy award for this one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01432=The tell-tale rumbling has begun. I expect we'll be seeing a lava surge soon, and a big one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01433=Our seismologist believes the coming lava surge is breaching the mantle--Terry, this is boring science stuff! I'm not reading this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01434=A jolt of seismic activity rocks the surface of Veridia Prime. The lava won't be too far behind!
Conversation/acObj/Line01435=Another increase in seismic activity! A lava surge is coming. Will this finally be the big one?
Conversation/acObj/Line01436=That earthquake only signals one thing... Another lava surge is coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01437=Another quake. Another lava surge coming soon. Trust Donny Vermillion to get you the updates you need.
Conversation/acObj/Line01438=I've just gotten an update... (dramatic)The lava is here!
Conversation/acObj/Line01439=Word is the lava is hitting now. Let's go live to the planetary feed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01440=Another lava surge is here. Evacuation of the low ground had better be underway!
Conversation/acObj/Line01441=I'm getting a report that the lava is surging right now. Let's switch to lava cam six!
Conversation/acObj/Line01442=The lava has arrived once more... and UNN's film crew is on the scene!
Conversation/acObj/Line01443=The lava surge is back, viewers. Let's watch as the low ground is engulfed in molten rock and fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01444=Looks like the lava has fully receded. Can the commanders' workers make up for the lost time?
Conversation/acObj/Line01445=The lava has receded once more, leaving both crystals and destruction in its wake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01446=The lava surge is ending, viewers, but stay with us! I'm sure there's a lot more excitement to come!
Conversation/acObj/Line01447=It looks like that surge is finally over with. Let's watch the commanders get back to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01448=We're hearing that the lava is receding and the race to reactivate the stabilizer is back on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01449=It looks like the surge is over, for now. But when the burning tides rise again, we'll be there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01450=What's that rumbling? Four thousand degrees of molten death. Surging every few minutes, the lava is truly a force of nature.
Conversation/acObj/Line01451=Experts say lava surges occur every few minutes, obliterating anything in the way. That low ground is a dangerous place to be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01452=And it looks like the lava is already rising! Let's watch as the commanders below take refuge upon higher ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01453=I'm getting reports that the lava is surging now. Hopefully the low ground areas have already been cleared.
Conversation/acObj/Line01454=A commander's air support has taken a devastating hit from a lava spout. It's too much to watch! (aside)Of course, keep rolling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01455=A direct hit from a lava spout! Younger viewers may want to turn away!
Conversation/acObj/Line01456=We're still waiting for workers to collect a crystal and bring it to the stabilizer. Hopefully, things pick up soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01457=The timetable says workers should be collecting crystals by now. Makes you wonder, did Valerian choose the wrong allies?
Conversation/acObj/Line01460=I'm getting word that the environmental stabilizer is now at 25%. Which is still three quarters of a failure.
Conversation/acObj/Line01461=Even with the odds against them, workers have managed to reach 25% stability. A truly unexpected accomplishment.
Conversation/acObj/Line01462=This is Donny Vermillion reporting that the stabilizer has reached 50%. Workers are moving as fast as they can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01463=The environmental stabilizer has reached the halfway point. A big moment for the forces down below.
Conversation/acObj/Line01464=Only 25% remains 'til the stabilizer is charged. But is there enough time left?
Conversation/acObj/Line01465=Beyond all belief, the stabilizer is nearly charged! Can they make it? I'll be here to find out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01468=We're four minutes away from the planet's destruction... Keep watching UNN for constant coverage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01469=UNN Seismologist Terry estimates the planet has four minutes remaining. Let's see if you're right, Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01470=Only three minutes remain. Keep your eyes glued to the holo-screen. Anything could happen!
Conversation/acObj/Line01471=With three minutes remaining, you have to wonder what's going through the commanders' minds? Fear? Doubt? Likely both.
Conversation/acObj/Line01472=Updated reports indicate they've reached the two-minute mark. Hopefully they start working faster.
Conversation/acObj/Line01473=Terry, the counter shows two minutes left. Should we be getting out of orbit? We're fine? Okay, good.
Conversation/acObj/Line01474=We're down to the final minute. Keep watching the feed, as I'll be with you to the inevitable bitter end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01475=There's one minute left. One single... solitary... minute. (aside)Brought to you by UNN.
Conversation/acObj/Line01476=A Molten Salamander has emerged from the lava! Conservationists say they're endangered, but who's in danger now?
Conversation/acObj/Line01477=A Molten Salamander agitated by the lava is attacking the downtown area. We're going to see if we can get a closer shot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01478=The Salamander has resurfaced. I normally don't editorialize, but that thing looks angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01479=Flames spread as the Molten Salamander resurfaces. Will the Dominion's allies intervene, or leave this creature unchecked?
Conversation/acObj/Line01480=While Molten Sal is no more, its contributions to this fair city will never be forgotten.
Conversation/acObj/Line01481=Molten Sal was brutally slain by Dominion allies today, leaving many to wonder... who was the real fire-breathing monster?
Conversation/acObj/Line01482=Could the Emperor's allies have done more? The answer is yes. Thanks Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01483=A devastating loss. This will surely haunt Emperor Valerian to the end of his reign.
Conversation/acObj/Line01484=Oh, watch this, viewers. The commanders are going to need to fly carefully to avoid the magma spouts bursting from the lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01485=Looks like they're flying over the lava. That's a bold move with those lava spouts. (aside)They know about the lava spouts, right?
Conversation/acObj/Line01493=Oh, the horror... a worker has died before our very eyes. Hopefully another can carry on their work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01494=A commander just lost a worker, dropping their precious cargo. Can it be recovered? Or is all hope already lost?
Conversation/acObj/Line01495=If you're just joining us, a worker has been killed. Unfortunately, the Dominion military has yet to comment on the tragedy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01499=The lava is receding... and it's left behind some crystals. The commanders will be trying to gather those before the lava sweeps them away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01500=Looks like the receding lava has left behind crystals. For Veridia's sake, let's hope the workers gather those quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01501=It appears the receding lava has unearthed some crystals. With any luck, workers will get them to the stabilizer quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01502=A worker has been slain, and their cargo has fallen... a terrible loss. Oh, and the worker will be missed as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01503=A gruesome sight as a worker carrying a xenon crystal has died. Another unfortunate setback, surely to be felt by all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01504=More lava? Coming soon? I don't believe you. Admit it, you're desperate for attention, Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01505=Another lava surge has come! We'll have more after this short message from our sponsor.
Conversation/acObj/Line01506=I like to think the lava moves the crystals around. Terry says that's "unscientific." Don't listen to Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01507=Viewers, a commander's air units have just been hit by a lava spout, and I've got the footage. Let's replay it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01508=Breaking news. The enemy forces are attempting to stop the commanders' workers. We'll have more as the situation develops.
Conversation/acObj/Line01509=Are enemy forces about to attack the commanders' workers? Stay tuned to find out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01510=I'm getting word the enemy forces are attacking the commanders' workers. Let's watch as the battle erupts. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01511=The first crystal has been turned in, putting a little more time on what I'm calling "the countdown to destruction!"
Conversation/acObj/Line01512=As the workers turn in crystals, the stabilizer, uh, stabilizes... prolonging the coming doom by a few more moments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01513=Bringing a crystal to the stabilizer has bought them some time. But it will take more than time to heal this planet's wounds.
Conversation/acObj/Line01514=Commanders? Are you... are you real? Sorry, I've been here a while, and the terrazine... Not the best for my sanity! (Nervous laugh) ...It's not.
Conversation/acObj/Line01515=In case you ARE real, someone out there has been messing with my harvesting bots. Would you mind keeping an eye on them for me?
Conversation/acObj/Line01516=Hi, commanders! I thought everyone had forgotten about me out here. The hallucinations are the only visitors I've had.
Conversation/acObj/Line01517=I guess that's terrazine for you. Speaking of, someone's been destroying my harvesting bots. Could you provide an escort for them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01518=Welcome to the jungle, Commanders! Hope you like fun and games! Long term exposure to terrazine provides plenty of both! Trust me!
Conversation/acObj/Line01519=Someone out there is making a game of destroying my bots, though. They're ruining my research! I need you to guard those bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01520=Looks like a geyser's about to become active! One of my bots will depart for it shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01521=The first geyser should be opening up soon. I'll send a bot out for it when it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line01522=Ooh, I've located a soon-to-be active geyser. Make sure to escort the bot I'll send to harvest it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01523=Bel'shir says that some more geysers are opening up soon. Don't worry if you can't hear her. She only talks to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01524=More geysers are gonna be active soon. Don't ask how I know that. I just... do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01525=Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/acObj/Line01526=Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. You can always count on Bel'shir to provide what you need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01527=Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01528=If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Conversation/acObj/Line01529=Some geysers are gonna be opening in a few moments. My bots can smell them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01530=You know what I'm about to say, right, eh? That there are more geysers on the way? Get out of my head!
Conversation/acObj/Line01531=The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Conversation/acObj/Line01532=These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Conversation/acObj/Line01533=Looks like these are the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01534=These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01535=Hey! Heads up! I'm sending out the first bot. Make sure to protect it! It's my favorite.
Conversation/acObj/Line01536=Okay, I'm sending a bot to collect the geyser's terrazine. Don't let it get destroyed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01537=My bot is departing now. It's fully automated, so all you have to do is keep it alive. Yes, it's alive. It's alive! Uh, sorry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01538=Bots are on their way, commanders! Please keep the little guys out of trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line01539=Sending out the best of my bots! Well, the best of what's left, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01540=My bots really want to get to the terrazine. They're kinda impatient, so I'm letting them out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01541=Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Conversation/acObj/Line01542=Bots away! (Laughs at his own joke) What? I thought it was funny. Bel'shir laughs every time I tell it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01543=I built these bots myself, in a cave, with a box of scraps! So I'd appreciate it if they came back intact.
Conversation/acObj/Line01544=I think the bots are telling me they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They've lied to me before, those little miscreants!
Conversation/acObj/Line01545=There go the bots! (Sniffs) They grow up so fast! Daddy loves you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01546=My bot is collecting the terrazine now. You'll have to defend it until it's done.
Conversation/acObj/Line01547=Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Conversation/acObj/Line01548=Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Keep an eye out for trouble, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01549=Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Conversation/acObj/Line01550=Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Conversation/acObj/Line01551=Oh benevolent Bel'shir, I humbly ask that you gift me with your terrazine. The commanders have promised to protect it. Right?
Conversation/acObj/Line01552=Gathering the terrazine now. Remember, commanders: Constant vigilance!
Conversation/acObj/Line01553=This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01554=Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Conversation/acObj/Line01555=My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01556=Acquiring the terrazine now. Keep those bots safe, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01557=The harvesting bot is returning now. You'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line01558=The bot is heading back. It's scared, so you should keep it company.
Conversation/acObj/Line01559=A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely.
Conversation/acObj/Line01560=Come on home, little bots! The commanders will protect you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01561=Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I need that terrazine, commanders... for my... experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01562=The bots are returning to me now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike SOME people.
Conversation/acObj/Line01563=Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Don't let them get away from you!
Conversation/acObj/Line01564=And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (Whispers) My money's on Gary. He always gets the best oil.
Conversation/acObj/Line01565=Bots are heading home. They're sheep in need of a shepherd, commanders. And there are a lot of wolves on the prowl.
Conversation/acObj/Line01566=My bots are heading back to base. Be careful, commanders. It's a jungle out there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01567=Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line01568=They're coming after my bots! Stop them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01569=Gah, here come the bad guys! Uh, who are they, again?
Conversation/acObj/Line01570=I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line01571=Look out, commanders! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01572=The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. Don't, don't, don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01573=Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Conversation/acObj/Line01574=What's this? Enemy forces en route to my bots? It's just like Bel'shir said!
Conversation/acObj/Line01575=Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have put more turrets on those things!
Conversation/acObj/Line01576=Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01577=I see you, enemy scum! They're going to attack my bots, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01578=Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Conversation/acObj/Line01579=Oh commanders, the enemy is warping in near the bot! I wish I had that kind of tech...
Conversation/acObj/Line01580=They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Conversation/acObj/Line01581=Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01582=Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01583=They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01584=It's raining zerg! Death from above! Save the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01585=The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Conversation/acObj/Line01586=Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01587=What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Conversation/acObj/Line01588=A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Conversation/acObj/Line01589=No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Conversation/acObj/Line01590=Umm, the Void Thrashers are back! They'll tear my bots apart if you don't stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01591=Oh by the way commanders, there seem to be more Void Thrashers around. Just keeping you informed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01592=Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01593=Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line01594=A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01595=That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line01596=More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01597=These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Conversation/acObj/Line01598=Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Conversation/acObj/Line01599=Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! Commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01600=(Sing-song voice) My bots are under attack... My bots are under attack...
Conversation/acObj/Line01601=Good morning, commanders! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01602=What's made to last forever and being destroyed? My bots, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line01603=The enemy's attacking my bots! Geez, commanders, can't you keep a hold of aggro!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01604=Enemy forces have converged on my bots! Everybody, get in there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01605=Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01606=Please, please, please stop the enemy from breaking my stuff!
Conversation/acObj/Line01607=My bots are taking damage! Terrible, terrible damage!
Conversation/acObj/Line01608=They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01611=The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01612=Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01618=Hey! I worked hard on that! I need those bots in order to harvest the terrazine, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01619=Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01620=Okay, that was my favorite bot! (Frustrated grunt) Please try to not lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01624=What's that noise? Oh, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01625=No, no, no! Not my bots! You monsters! We can't lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01626=Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots, commanders! They're all I have left!
Conversation/acObj/Line01627=That's a good little bot! Welcome home! I missed you so much!
Conversation/acObj/Line01628=The bots are back in town, the bots are back in town! (Makes guitar noises)
Conversation/acObj/Line01629=Look, commanders, bots! Oh, those are mine. (Gasps) And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01630=Good news, commanders! My bots have brought me terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01631=Hey uh, great job, commanders! My bots are safe and sound. Do you do this sort of thing often?
Conversation/acObj/Line01632=Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet this time, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line01633=My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01634=We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01635=Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to finish my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line01636=I think I have a little less than half the terrazine I need. I guess I'll be sending out more bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01637=My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I should really send her a thank you card...
Conversation/acObj/Line01638=Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line01639=Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01640=I've got almost all the terrazine I need! Keep it up, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01641=Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line01642=Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! I need just a tiny bit more, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01643=Noooo! Now I'll never finish my research! Do you have any idea what I've been through on this planet!? Argh!
Conversation/acObj/Line01644=(Frustrated exertion) It's ruined! It's all ruined! Just like my graduate thesis project!
Conversation/acObj/Line01645=Yes! I can finally finish this research and get off this godforsaken rock! (Beat) I'm sorry, Bel'shir! I didn't mean it like that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01646=Research complete. Haha, that was pretty good! I crack me up. But seriously, let's get the hell out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01647=Nice work, commanders! You've done science a great service today. Now uhh... any chance I could get a ride off world?
Conversation/acObj/Line01648=Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Commanders, try to free it if you can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01649=This is an outrage! The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! We have to stop them! Or not, your choice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01650=They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic Bel'shir gliders! You... might want to stop them if you can, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01651=Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. You know what to do or not do, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01652=Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. Maybe we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01653=Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. Do you think you have the time to set it free?
Conversation/acObj/Line01654=The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If you want to save it, you'll have to do it before it's completely drained.
Conversation/acObj/Line01655=Uh, we have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. Try not to forget about it. Being forgotten sucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01656=So, I'm not saying you have to, but if you want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, you don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01657=Once the Bel'shir glider's terrazine is gone, it'll be dead. So try to free it sooner than later. If you have a heart, that is.
Conversation/acObj/Line01658=(Mumbles calculations to himself)By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. You don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01659=The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world, commanders. You'll miss your chance if you don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01660=Well, you're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death, commanders. If you were ever planning on it, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01661=The Bel'shir glider is almost dead, commanders. It's now or never. Literally. You could choose either one.
Conversation/acObj/Line01662=Wow, you really just let that thing die. And I thought I knew you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01663=Well, that's one dead whale. It was probably endangered, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01664=They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this...
Conversation/acObj/Line01665=All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! Tsk tsk. What a tragedy... just like my career.
Conversation/acObj/Line01666=You saved it! Bel'shir thanks you, commanders. I mean... I thank you. Yes. Me. With the thanking.
Conversation/acObj/Line01667=I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01668=Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
Conversation/acObj/Line01669=You know, I never noticed those things floating around here before. I wonder where they came from.
Conversation/acObj/Line01670=Glad you're with us, Commanders. This planet is crawling with infested, and I need to get my people out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01671=Those things attack us whenever we spin up our engines. If you don't protect us while we launch, we'll never get off this rock.
Conversation/acObj/Line01672=This is Debra Greene, guildmaster of the local Kel-Morian mining crew. My people have to be evacuated as soon as possible.
Conversation/acObj/Line01673=Our ships can't start their launch sequences without attracting the infested. We need you to protect us until we're up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01674=Everything's gone straight to hell, Commanders. This mining operation is over, and we need to leave right now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01675=But without your protection, the infested will tear us apart before we can even take off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01676=I'll send you the coordinates of our ships. If you set up a perimeter at one of them, its pilot will start the launch sequence.
Conversation/acObj/Line01677=Here are the locations of our ships. Each one of them will fire up its engines when you're in range to protect it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01678=We have several ships ready for launch. Head out to one of them when you're ready so that it can prepare for lift off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01679=Keep your guard up. You'll have to keep the infested at bay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01680=It won't be long before the noise draws the infested to your location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01681=Now listen, you need to hold off the infested until the ship's in the sky.
Conversation/acObj/Line01682=Engines are starting up. Get ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01683=Starting the launch sequence. That's sure to get the infested's attention.
Conversation/acObj/Line01684=We're counting on you, commanders. Launch in progress.
Conversation/acObj/Line01685=Here we go. Keep the ship safe, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01686=Hold the line while the engines are warming up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01687=Can't thank you enough for this, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01688=That ship, and all of its passengers, are in your hands. Don't let them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01689=Incoming infested. Stop them from reaching the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01690=Commanders, one of my pilots is getting antsy. I think he might try to launch without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01691=I've got a ship that can't wait any longer. They'll be taking off soon, with or without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01692=My people don't have much time. They gotta launch soon, whether you're there or not.
Conversation/acObj/Line01693=That damn fool pilot's started the engines. Commanders, that ship won't make it on its own.
Conversation/acObj/Line01694=A ship's engines are firing up, and the infested are on their way. You have to help!
Conversation/acObj/Line01695=The ship's trying to launch without you. They can't get off the ground before the infested arrive!
Conversation/acObj/Line01696=People are panicking on one of the ships. I think its pilot's about to hit the launch button.
Conversation/acObj/Line01697=We've got a problem. One of the ships is getting ready to launch on its own.
Conversation/acObj/Line01698=One of the ships is desperate to go. Don't know how much longer I can convince them to wait.
Conversation/acObj/Line01699=A ship is going to make a run for it. It won't get far without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01700=Gotta get moving, commanders. People on that ship would rather die running than waiting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01701=Another ship is out of time. Its pilot has no choice but to launch soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01702=I'm detecting lots of infested headed for that ship. It has to get off the ground pronto.
Conversation/acObj/Line01703=There's a leak in that ship's fuel line. They have to launch real soon, or they won't have enough left to reach orbit.
Conversation/acObj/Line01704=Ship's starting to launch. Help them, before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line01705=Here come the infested. Keep them off of that ship, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01706=That ship needs your help, commanders. It won't survive the infested without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01707=Engines are up and running. The infested are sure to follow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01708=You need to get to that ship before the infested rip it to pieces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01709=They've started the launch sequence. I know they're jumping the gun, but they still need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01710=Time's up. That ship is going now, like it or not. They'll never make it alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01711=The infested are coming for that ship. It's up to you to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01712=The infested have reached a ship. Stop them while there's still time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01713=That ship is taking damage from the infested, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01714=You've got to hold off the infested. Those monsters are already clawing through the hull!
Conversation/acObj/Line01715=Don't let the infested destroy the ship! My people's lives are at stake!
Conversation/acObj/Line01716=I got a ship calling for help. The infested are right on top of them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01717=That ship's plating won't keep the infested out for long. You need to fight them off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01718=Those people are in danger, commanders. They will die without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01719=The infested are attacking the ship. You have to do something, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01720=Gotta act fast, commanders. The infested have almost burrowed into that ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01721=The infested are getting close to destroying that ship. Make sure that they don't.
Conversation/acObj/Line01722=If the infested keep at it much longer, they'll rupture that ship's fuel line and blow it sky high.
Conversation/acObj/Line01723=You cannot allow the infested to continue attacking the ship. They'll kill everyone inside.
Conversation/acObj/Line01724=Commanders, that ship is in big trouble. You can't just let its passengers die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01725=The people aboard that ship are staring death in the face. Help them, please.
Conversation/acObj/Line01726=That ship's starting to break apart. You gotta get the infested off of it right away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01727=Won't be long before that ship is torn open. Kill the infested before that happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line01736=Ship's ready to go! Commanders, feel free to pull back from that launch point.
Conversation/acObj/Line01737=Okay, that ship's on its way out. Time to focus on the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line01738=That ship's getting out of here. No need to commit any more forces to it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01739=Evacuation in progress. We're in your debt, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01740=Engines to full, ship's in the sky. Those people get to live.
Conversation/acObj/Line01741=We have liftoff! At least some of us will survive this mess. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01742=We don't have a lot of time here. Move out and protect the ships so they can launch.
Conversation/acObj/Line01743=Daylight's burning. I have to get my people off this planet, and I need you to help me do it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01744=You need to defend those ships, commanders. There's no hope for them without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01745=Wait too long before heading out, and there might not be anyone left to save.
Conversation/acObj/Line01746=My people are depending on you. Don't keep them waiting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01747=My friends and family are on those ships. And they need your protection.
Conversation/acObj/Line01748=I promised my people they'd get home safe. I can't keep that promise without your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01749=Those are good people out there, commanders. Don't let them die alone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01750=Sitting there, waiting to be killed... that's no way to go. Defend that ship, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01751=Don't abandon that ship, commanders. You're their only chance of survival.
Conversation/acObj/Line01752=Commanders, it's a huge risk to start more than one launch at a time. Please, do not let this backfire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01753=You're gambling with people's lives by trying to launch several ships at once. If you fail, they're the ones who lose.
Conversation/acObj/Line01754=Launching multiple ships is extremely dangerous. It gets us out of here faster, but the infested could overwhelm us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01755=Friends of yours? Didn't think so. They're getting ready to attack one of my ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01756=Looks like Amon himself wants us to die. Won't be long before his forces attack a ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01757=As if things couldn't get worse. It seems that Amon's preparing an attack against a ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01758=Another attack wave is about to head out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01759=Amon's forces are gathering for another attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01760=Gonna have some unwelcome guests real soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01761=Looks like the enemy army is about to attack us again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01762=I reckon the enemy's gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01763=Seems like it's about time for another enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01764=I'm seeing an enemy attack on the horizon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01765=Amon's about to mobilize his forces. Get ready.
Conversation/acObj/Line01766=That enemy attack is on its way. Intercept it before it reaches the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01767=Hostiles are heading directly for one of the ships. You have to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01768=The infested are one thing, but Amon's forces are an even bigger threat. Take 'em out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01769=The enemy's making a beeline toward a ship. Don't let them reach it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01770=Heads up, commanders. We've got company coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line01771=They're heading for the ship again. You know what to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01772=Here they come. That ship won't last long against them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01773=Incoming enemy attack. They're headed for one of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01774=Enemy's on the move. Gotta put a stop to them, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01775=The enemy just left their base. We don't have much time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01776=Amon's forces are inbound, and that ship is defenseless.
Conversation/acObj/Line01777=If Amon's forces reach the ship, they'll destroy it in no time. Do not let that happen.
Conversation/acObj/Line01778=That ship is a sitting duck, commanders. It won't survive an enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01779=Enemy's getting close to a ship. You're running out of time to stop 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01780=You have to stop that enemy attack, commanders. They'll kill everyone on that ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01781=The enemy's painted a target on my people's back, and they're taking aim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01782=Don't forget about that enemy attack. It'll wipe out a ship much faster than the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01783=Amon's forces are closing the distance. They have to be stopped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01784=Won't be long before the enemy starts attacking the ship, and those people start to die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01785=The enemy's attacking the ship. You have to draw their attention away from it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01786=Amon's forces are destroying the ship. Those people are in danger!
Conversation/acObj/Line01787=A ship is under attack. Lives are depending on you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01788=The people on that ship will get killed if you don't stop that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01789=If my people die to this attack, their blood will be on your hands.
Conversation/acObj/Line01790=That ship stands no chance against an enemy army. You have to intervene.
Conversation/acObj/Line01791=Can't waste any more time, commanders! That ship is getting hammered!
Conversation/acObj/Line01792=This ain't good. Amon's forces are gonna smash that ship to pieces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01793=Don't know why these guys want us dead, but I'm glad you're here to defend us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01794=Well, that's one fewer disaster to worry about. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01795=Nice work. Now we can focus on the infested again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01796=That bought that ship a little more time. It might make all the difference.
Conversation/acObj/Line01797=People on that ship are cheering for you. Hell, so am I.
Conversation/acObj/Line01798=You just saved a lot of lives, commanders. We owe you big.
Conversation/acObj/Line01799=Hopefully, Amon'll think twice before trying that again. But I doubt it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01800=We just might get out of here alive, after all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01801=I'll be damned... the infested just took out Amon's forces. Enemy of my enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01802=As far as I'm concerned, Amon's forces and the infested can go right on killing each other.
Conversation/acObj/Line01803=I guess not even Amon's army can ignore the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01804=Never thought I'd thank the infested for anything. But they sure took care of that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01805=The infested just destroyed Amon's attack force. And I thought they were dangerous before...
Conversation/acObj/Line01806=I promised those people I'd get them home safe... We have to protect the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line01807=They're gone... just like that. We can't let the same happen to the rest of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01808=Grief has to wait. The other ships must be defended at all costs.
Conversation/acObj/Line01809=No, not again! We barely have enough ships as it is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01810=Damn it, no! If we lose too many ships, we'll have no way to evacuate.
Conversation/acObj/Line01811=So many dead... If we keep losing ships, there's no way we'll survive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01812=We can't afford to lose any more ships! Don't let us die out here, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01813=These... these are the last of our ships. We lose another, and we're done for.
Conversation/acObj/Line01814=Just one more ship lost, and there won't be enough left to save the survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line01815=We're off to a good start. Keep it up, and we'll get everyone safely evacuated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01816=A fair number of my people have made it to orbit, but we've still got a ways to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01817=That ship's safe now, but there are several more that need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line01818=The people on that ship owe you their lives. But there are still a few more to get up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01819=Evacuation efforts are going well, commanders. Just gotta keep protecting those ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01820=I'd say roughly half of my crew still needs evac. We're counting on you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01821=Just a few of my people are left on the planet. We're almost there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01822=That's almost everyone. Got a few more to evacuate, then we can all get out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01823=Keep holding the line, commanders. Evacuation is almost complete.
Conversation/acObj/Line01824=We call that thing Blightbringer. Meanest zerg I've ever seen. Might wanna take it out if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01825=That's Blightbringer. Killed a lot of us when the infestation started. Return the favor, if you get the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01826=Think the infested are bad? Blightbringer puts 'em to shame. Kill it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01827=Blightbringer won't stay above ground forever. If you're gonna kill it, you should do it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01828=Not sure if you wanna deal with Blightbringer, but it looks like it wants to scurry away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01829=I think Blightbringer is gonna burrow into the ground. If you wanna squash it, do it fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01830=Blightbringer's made its escape. Makes me nervous knowing it's somewhere out there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01831=You didn't get around to killing Blightbringer? Don't worry about it. I'd rather we both live than die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01832=Looks like Blightbringer's gone. It can have this damn planet for all I care.
Conversation/acObj/Line01833=Blightbringer's dead. And good riddance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01834=Won't bring back the people it killed, but thank you for at least giving them justice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01835=Thank you for that, commanders. We just didn't have the firepower to deal with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01836=The KMC supplied us with Eradicators, but they've gone haywire. If you could deal with them for us, I'd appreciate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01837=Our Eradicators started malfunctioning as the infestation began. Think you'll have time to destroy them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01838=Those Eradicators are out of control. They could be dangerous. If you can, try to break them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01839=If the Eradicators reenter the facility, you won't be able to reach them. You gotta move it if you want to hit them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01840=The Eradicators are about to return to the facility. If you're going to handle them, do it sooner than later.
Conversation/acObj/Line01841=You can't attack the Eradicators after they're back in the facility. Hurry up if you want to destroy 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01842=The Eradicators have gone back inside the facility. Really hope they don't blow up the planet or anything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01843=Just saw the Eradicators retreat to the facility. Forget about them, they're not a threat anymore.
Conversation/acObj/Line01844=Eradicators are gone. Maybe if we're lucky, they'll incinerate everything after the evacuation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01845=Eradicators are down. Thank you, commanders. No telling what those things were going to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01846=Never did trust those things. That's what you get when the KMC tries to copy Umojan tech.
Conversation/acObj/Line01847=You've busted up the Eradicators. Damn things did squat to protect us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01848=That was it. That was our last hope. We're dead, commanders. All of us are dead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01849=People in the ships were lucky. They died quick. But the rest of us...
Conversation/acObj/Line01850=That's the last of us. I can't thank you enough, commanders. You've saved us all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01851=Alright, that's everyone. Let's get on out of here! Thank you, commanders. For everything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01852=Evacuation's complete! We went through hell down there, commanders. Thank you for getting us out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01853=We... must... feed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01854=You'll never take me alive, you bastards!
Conversation/acObj/Line01855=Intruder detected!
Conversation/acObj/Line01856=Exterminate! Exterminate!
Conversation/acObj/Line01857=Listen up, commanders. We've got a serious level of infestation here, and we need to burn it out STAT.
Conversation/acObj/Line01858=These monsters are dangerous at night, but they burn up during the day. That's when we'll torch the infested structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01859=Finally, some back up! Look, I need to get rid of this infestation before it spreads to the rest of the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01860=The infested come out at night, but they can't survive the daylight. Use that time to take out their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01861=This planet is in serious trouble. If this infestation spreads, there won't be any survivors. We need to stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01862=It's risky to move at night, but the infested die off during the day. When the sun is up, move out and burn their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01863=Heads up, commanders. The day's almost over, which means the infested are gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01864=We're almost out of daylight. Once the sun sets, the infested will come knocking on our door.
Conversation/acObj/Line01865=Night's almost here. I'd start getting ready to deal with the infested if I were you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01866=Looks like the sun's about to set. Get ready for nightfall.
Conversation/acObj/Line01867=Don't go out too far. There isn't much time left in the day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01868=The day's going to end soon, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01869=Another day's coming to an end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01870=Make the most of the day, commanders. It's nearly over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01871=It's almost nighttime. Be ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01872=Time is running out. Don't forget that our base will need to be defended at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01873=It's nighttime, commanders! Fight off the infested until daybreak!
Conversation/acObj/Line01874=That's the last of the sunlight. Our defenses have to hold until the night is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01875=The sun is down! Defend against the infested until it rises again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01876=We're in for a rough night, but I know we can survive it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01877=Sit tight, commanders. This night's just getting started. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01878=Another night, another fight. Keep them out of our base!
Conversation/acObj/Line01879=A lot of dead out there. Make sure that we don't join them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01880=I knew the infestation was bad, but this is crazy! Hold them off!
Conversation/acObj/Line01881=Just keep fighting, commanders. We'll make it through the night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01882=Here come the infested. We have to hold them off until sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01883=The sun will rise any minute now. Then the infested will burn away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01884=Just a little longer, commanders. The infested can't survive in the sun.
Conversation/acObj/Line01885=The night's almost over. We'll be safe to move out again in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01886=We can do this, commanders. It's almost sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01887=Keep it up! Night's coming to an end soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01888=The infested can attack us all they want. Soon, it's gonna be our turn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01889=This may look bad, but it won't last much longer. Morning's almost here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01890=Daybreak is just around the corner. Hold the line until then!
Conversation/acObj/Line01891=Don't give up, commanders. This nightmare is about to end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01892=It won't be long now. We just have to survive until dawn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01893=You sure you want to do that at night, commanders? The infested will be here any minute!
Conversation/acObj/Line01894=I like the hustle, but I'd advise against it, commanders. It'll be easier to take out the structures in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01895=Don't get too bold out there. If our base falls to the infested, this planet will be lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01896=Sending you the coordinates for more structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01897=I've got another sector with structures on my scanners.
Conversation/acObj/Line01898=We're not done yet, commanders. Here are some more structures to burn out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01899=Looks like we can find additional structures here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01900=Detecting more structures at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01901=Ugh. Amon. Great. Looks like we have to fight through his forces to get to the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01902=Amon's forces are trying to keep us away from the structures. Don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01903=I'm picking up hostile forces headed for the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01904=So we have to fight Amon's forces AND the infested? This just keeps getting better...
Conversation/acObj/Line01905=I can't believe Amon's forces are trying to protect those structures. Take them out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01906=Look out for those hunterlings. They're fast, and boy can they JUMP.
Conversation/acObj/Line01907=Incoming hunterlings! They're cliff jumpers, so watch out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01908=Hunterlings! Those things move fast, and they can jump up cliffs!
Conversation/acObj/Line01909=We call these ones "kaboomers." They spit acid, and they explode when they die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01910=Keep your distance from those kaboomers. We call them that for a reason, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01911=The marines named these ones "kaboomers." The acid spit is bad enough, but just wait until they explode.
Conversation/acObj/Line01912=Chokers. They'll pull in your forces and stun them if they aren't dealt with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01913=Those chokers are bad news. They'll pull in their prey and stun them with their toxins.
Conversation/acObj/Line01914=Beware of those chokers. They'll stun and kill your forces after pulling them in.
Conversation/acObj/Line01915=Spotters are in the air. Shoot them down before they become a problem.
Conversation/acObj/Line01916=Detecting some spotters. They can fly, so you better keep an eye on them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01917=The infested have spotters in the sky. You should probably deal with them soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01918=A stank!? Those things are resistant to sunlight! We have to be the ones to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01919=That stank is strong enough to withstand sunlight. We have to kill it ourselves.
Conversation/acObj/Line01920=Oh no, not a stank! If we don't kill it, it'll keep attacking us even after sunrise!
Conversation/acObj/Line01921=One of our barricades is being hit hard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01922=The infested are trying to break through one of our barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01923=A barricade is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line01924=We've got a barricade taking some damage here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01925=I'm seeing the infested gather at one of the barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01926=Looks like they're trying to tear down a barricade.
Conversation/acObj/Line01927=You'll have to defend that barricade if it's going to stay standing.
Conversation/acObj/Line01928=Commanders, that barricade won't hold up for much longer.
Conversation/acObj/Line01929=Uh, we might have a problem with that barricade pretty soon here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01930=One of our barricades is nearly destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01931=The infested are about to take down that barricade!
Conversation/acObj/Line01932=Keep the infested off that barricade, or it's going to fall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01933=We've lost a barricade! Get some defenses in place or the infested will walk right in!
Conversation/acObj/Line01934=There goes a barricade... We're going to need more defenses at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01935=Commanders! The infested have broken through a barricade! We have to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01936=A barricade's been destroyed! Without additional defenses, our base will be crawling with infested!
Conversation/acObj/Line01937=The infested have brought down a barricade. We have to put up more defenses or we're in big trouble!
Conversation/acObj/Line01938=Okay, commanders. We need to destroy enough structures today to stay ahead of the infestation. I've already marked a few for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01939=We made it to the dawn. To stop the infestation, we need to destroy enough of it each day. Head to these coordinates to start.
Conversation/acObj/Line01940=Time to get to work. We have to burn away enough of the infestation before the day ends. Start with the structures I've marked.
Conversation/acObj/Line01941=Looks like we survived another night. I've updated the number of structures we need to destroy today to stay on track.
Conversation/acObj/Line01942=Let's get to work, commanders. We have to burn enough of the infestation today so that we don't fall behind.
Conversation/acObj/Line01943=Sunrise, that's our cue to move. We won't have enough time later if we destroy too few structures today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01944=Good morning, commanders. We've got two days left, and our work is definitely cut out for us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01945=We have two more days to stop the infestation. Let's make them count.
Conversation/acObj/Line01946=Boy, the days go by fast on this planet. We have two more to burn away the infestation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01947=Let's do this, commanders! Finish off the infestation today, or this planet is toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01948=We've come this far, and now it's time to end it. Take out the last of the infestation before the day is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01949=It's now or never, commanders. The people on this planet are counting on us. Burn all the infestation that's left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01950=We're making good progress, but there's still a lot of infestation to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01951=It looks like we've taken out a good amount of infestation. Just need to keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01952=There's still a lot of infestation left, but we'll get every last bit of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01953=We're halfway there, commanders. Keep it up and we can still save this planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01954=About half of the infestation has been cleared out. Don't give up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01955=My scans show that half of the infestation is gone. We can do this.
Conversation/acObj/Line01956=Most of the infestation has been dealt with. Just a little more to go!
Conversation/acObj/Line01957=The infestation is almost gone. But we need to get the rest of it for this to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01958=We've burned out almost all of the infestation. Let's finish the job.
Conversation/acObj/Line01959=I'm detecting a virophage in the field. Killing it could prevent future infestations, but we'll have to attack it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01960=Looks like there's a virophage among the infested. Might be a good idea to kill it, but we can only do that at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01961=There's a virophage out there, commanders. Kill it if you can, but you'll have to do it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01962=You have until sunrise to attack the virophage. If you can't kill it now, you can come back to it tomorrow night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01963=That virophage will burrow once the sun is up. It may take you more than one night to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01964=Don't worry if you can't kill the virophage tonight. I'm sure it'll be back tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01965=Nice job, commanders. Now we don't have to worry about the virophage after we clear out the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01966=You just saved me a lot of trouble, commanders. I was going to send a crew to exterminate that thing after this mission.
Conversation/acObj/Line01967=Well, that's one less headache to worry about on this planet. Thanks, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01968=Damn, there's just too much of it! We have to get as many people off this planet as we can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01969=There's no stopping the infestation now. This planet's gone, commanders. And a lot of people with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01970=That's the last of it! The planet's saved, commanders! And we have you to thank.
Conversation/acObj/Line01971=I can't believe it! We actually did it! I mean, of course we did it. Never had a doubt.
Conversation/acObj/Line01972=Haven't seen a situation that hairy since I was in the UED. Thanks for getting us through it, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01973=What, now those special infested are cloaked? Great, just what we needed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01974=Stay alert! Some of those special infested can cloak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01975=Looks like the special infested can cloak. Hope you're ready for this. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01976=Nice work, commanders! The more we torch today, the fewer we have to deal with tomorrow!
Conversation/acObj/Line01977=I see you were the right ones to call. At this rate, we'll have fewer structures to destroy tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01978=We've burned enough structures today, so tomorrow should be a little easier on us. Just a little.
Conversation/acObj/Line01979=Glad to be teamed up with fellow overachievers. We'll be less crunched for time tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01980=I have to say, I'm impressed. I'll revise the estimate for tomorrow based on what you've done today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01981=There's not much time left. Destroy enough of the structures today, or the infestation will grow out of control!
Conversation/acObj/Line01982=The sun's about to set! Torch those structures before it's too late!
Conversation/acObj/Line01983=We have to pick up the pace! Time is running out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01984=If we don't destroy more structures before sundown, this whole planet will be lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line01985=Come on, commanders. We don't have much more time to destroy those structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01986=Cutting it real close, here. Those structures need to burn before nightfall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01987=We're running out of daylight, and there are still more structures to burn!
Conversation/acObj/Line01988=Way to go! This infestation will be burned away in no time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01989=Whew! That's at least enough for today. But feel free to take out more of them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01990=Ugh, Amon's supporting the infested with his own forces. It's gonna be a long night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01991=Are you kidding me? Amon wants to attack us now, too? Perfect.
Conversation/acObj/Line01992=Looks like Amon wants a piece of us, too. Get those defenses in place!
Conversation/acObj/Line01993=Virophages are especially dangerous to air units. Proceed with caution.
Conversation/acObj/Line01994=Watch out, that virophage can make quick work of your air units.
Conversation/acObj/Line01995=Don't let that virophage take out too many of your air units, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01996=You have driven Amon from this world, and saved all who dwell here! Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01997=It is done! You have earned the gratitude of all Nerazim, commanders. We will honor your deeds forever.
Conversation/acObj/Line01998=The Voidshade hybrid is dead, and Amon's forces vanquished! We will rebuild this city, and undo what his minions have wrought.
Conversation/acObj/Line01999=Amon's new servant lives... It is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line02000=We did all we could... but this battle has ended.
Conversation/acObj/Line02001=And so the end comes...
Conversation/acObj/Line02002=Matriarch Vorazun sent me to investigate this world. Amon is using energies from the temple to awaken a Voidshade hybrid...
Conversation/acObj/Line02003=Matriarch, I have investigated Amon's presence on this world just as you ordered. He is using the temple's energies to create a Voidshade hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02004=This is unlike any foe I have seen! Destroy the Void Slivers before it is complete.
Conversation/acObj/Line02005=Amon's servants have desecrated these temple grounds to empower a Voidshade hybrid. If it succeeds, it could destroy us all.
Conversation/acObj/Line02006=You must strike down the Void Slivers to prevent its awakening!
Conversation/acObj/Line02007=When scouting this world, I discovered that Amon's forces have invaded the temple to raise a Voidshade hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02008=You cannot let him succeed. Eliminate his Void Slivers, and the abomination will not draw breath.
Conversation/acObj/Line02009=The Voidshade hybrid will awaken soon unless you destroy a sliver!
Conversation/acObj/Line02010=We must strike a Void Sliver! The hybrid has almost formed. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02011=The hybrid has drawn most of the power from the temple. Shatter a Void Sliver!
Conversation/acObj/Line02012=Act now, or we are lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line02013=We are on the edge of ruin, my friends! Fight with all you have!
Conversation/acObj/Line02014=We haven't a moment to spare. The hybrid is rising!
Conversation/acObj/Line02015=One sliver is down... You have bought yourselves time, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02016=The first Void Sliver is no more, but many remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line02017=You have crushed a Void Sliver! I knew you could be trusted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02018=Two Void Slivers have been annihilated. Good.
Conversation/acObj/Line02019=Ah, you have destroyed another sliver. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02020=A second sliver ends in ruin--as it should.
Conversation/acObj/Line02021=Over half of the slivers are gone now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02022=Amon will notice his slivers disappearing if you keep this up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02023=Excellent. Each felled Void Sliver gives us more time.
Conversation/acObj/Line02024=Another sliver is gone. You are turning the tide, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02025=Only one sliver remains, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02026=Yes! Destroy the last Void Sliver, and the hybrid shall die!
Conversation/acObj/Line02027=The people of this world have been trapped here since the battle began. We must ensure they depart soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02028=If you can help defend the ship when it leaves, I will not forget it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02029=Many protoss inhabit this world. Their lives are in danger as long as they remain here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02030=Please try to protect the evacuation ship after it departs.
Conversation/acObj/Line02031=I must ask another favor of you, friends. We are trying to evacuate the people of this city.
Conversation/acObj/Line02032=The ship leaves soon, and it could use any defenses you have to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line02033=The evacuation ship is heading out. Keep watch over it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02034=The evacuation vessel is moving forward. I pray it remains safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02035=Be on your guard. The evacuation ship is underway.
Conversation/acObj/Line02036=The ship will stop here to pick up more survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02037=Well done. Our vessel can warp more passengers aboard from here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02038=At last! We can evacuate everyone in this area now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02039=Make your preparations. The evacuation will resume soon. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02040=I must warn you--the ship will be leaving shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02041=The evacuation ship is almost ready to resume its course. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02042=A vessel was destroyed, but there is still hope. I will ready a replacement.
Conversation/acObj/Line02043=Our enemies have brought down a ship. We will try to send another soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02044=This ship has fallen... Do not let them succeed against the next one.
Conversation/acObj/Line02045=Alas... there are no remaining ships. This bodes ill for the survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02046=Our evacuation has failed, but at least we made a valiant attempt.
Conversation/acObj/Line02047=That was the last ship. I grieve for those we have left behind.
Conversation/acObj/Line02048=Against all odds, we have saved every survivor in the city. Well done, my friends.
Conversation/acObj/Line02049=The evacuations are complete. I shall rest easy knowing all are safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02050=We have done it! The evacuation was a success. My thanks to you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02051=This Purifier facility once converted warriors' personalities into AI. But it was shut down after complications with a Tal'darim prisoner.
Conversation/acObj/Line02052=His AI infected many of our systems, and I will need your assistance to purge them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02053=During the height of the Purifier program, many personalities were stored here for AI conversion. One of them turned out to be more than we could handle.
Conversation/acObj/Line02054=This Tal'darim, once a prisoner, has escaped and corrupted our systems to create his own forces. You must help me restore our control.
Conversation/acObj/Line02055=Purifiers were born here, converted from the personalities of great warriors. But one of them was merely a prisoner. A Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line02056=His AI personality managed to infiltrate our systems and turn them against us. I can undo the damage, but I will need your help.
Conversation/acObj/Line02057=Accessing security terminal and beginning data reset. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02058=Restoring original security protocol. Try to be patient.
Conversation/acObj/Line02059=Beginning security data restoration. Considerable wait time ahead.
Conversation/acObj/Line02060=Analyzing corrupted security data. Stand by.
Conversation/acObj/Line02061=Initiating security system rebuild. This will take a while.
Conversation/acObj/Line02062=I require aid. System defenses have been activated against me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02063=The Tal'darim still thinks he can destroy me. Can you prove him wrong?
Conversation/acObj/Line02064=Hostile forces have been deployed to my position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02065=System takeover is halfway complete. And yes, I am doing my best.
Conversation/acObj/Line02066=I have regained control of 50% of our systems, but it hasn't been easy.
Conversation/acObj/Line02067=Restoration efforts have reached the halfway point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02068=My work here is nearly finished, if you can believe it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02069=Only 25% of the corruption remains. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02070=I have overwritten three-quarters of the Tal'darim's alterations. Hold fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line02071=I have restored this location, but there are still other security terminals remaining.
Conversation/acObj/Line02072=The first location is secure. Unfortunately, the Tal'darim was quite thorough. I'll need to visit the other security terminals to purge them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02073=Initial security terminal is clear. Fear not, there are several more.
Conversation/acObj/Line02074=System integrity verified. We are back online at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line02075=Data secure. This security terminal is clear of corruption.
Conversation/acObj/Line02076=Despite the odds, everything has been fully reset here. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02077=The enemy has raised a suppression tower. Their beams will interfere with my work unless you destroy them. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02078=The facility's suppression towers used to protect us. But now, this one will bring my efforts to a halt if you do not stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02079=This suppression tower was once a useful defense. Now it is in the way of my work. Kindly dispose of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02080=Detecting another suppression tower.
Conversation/acObj/Line02081=I recommend taking out that suppression tower. Quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02082=Enemy suppression tower activated. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02083=Multiple suppression towers are readying attacks. Intervention is necessary.
Conversation/acObj/Line02084=Suppression towers are powering up in several locations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02085=Numerous suppression towers activating... (sarcastic) Just what we needed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02086=Tower destroyed. Good work. I will have to ask for more of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02087=The tower has ceased its fire. At least something is going right.
Conversation/acObj/Line02088=Suppression tower down. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02089=Tower attacks have temporarily disabled my systems.
Conversation/acObj/Line02090=I am unable to progress due to the tower's interruption.
Conversation/acObj/Line02091=Systems work halted by tower strikes.
Conversation/acObj/Line02092=I must proceed to the next security terminal soon. Make your preparations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02093=Nothing more to do here. I shall move on to the next area in a moment.
Conversation/acObj/Line02094=Warning--I will set out for the next location shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02095=I am about to head to the third terminal.
Conversation/acObj/Line02096=The transport is nearly ready. Relocating to the third terminal soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02097=Plotting a course to the final terminal. I will depart soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02098=Finalizing route to final terminal. Try to stay focused.
Conversation/acObj/Line02099=Transport en route.
Conversation/acObj/Line02100=Moving forward.
Conversation/acObj/Line02101=The transport is in motion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02102=Proceeding.
Conversation/acObj/Line02103=Advancing toward the next terminal now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02104=Transport damaged. I must pause my efforts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02105=I am under attack. Care to assist?
Conversation/acObj/Line02106=This is just a transport. It has no shields to defend me from these strikes!
Conversation/acObj/Line02107=Transport systems are near failure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02108=The enemy is breaking apart my transport!
Conversation/acObj/Line02109=My transport is nearly in ruins!
Conversation/acObj/Line02110=Interesting. One of the data cores has not yet been breached by the rogue Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line02112=Though the Tal'darim has been relentless, he has not yet gained access to this data core.
Conversation/acObj/Line02113=That Tal'darim is vindictive and will stop at nothing to invade every last one of our data cores.
Conversation/acObj/Line02114=I had nearly lost hope for this data core, but it's still possible to retrieve the personalities within it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02115=There are more personalities in the data core here. Try to reach them before the enemy does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02116=More of our Purifier kin are being stored in this data core. Recover them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02117=The data core... has been corrupted. There were no backups for the personalities within...
Conversation/acObj/Line02118=The Tal'darim has gained control of the data core. I fear for the personalities it held.
Conversation/acObj/Line02119=Data core lost. I grieve for those who passed with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02120=The Tal'darim destroyed our data core. He never possessed any honor, even in the flesh.
Conversation/acObj/Line02121=Excellent! We have saved the Purifier personalities from this data core.
Conversation/acObj/Line02123=Thanks to your diligence, the personalities of these warriors are safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02124=Fortunately, all of the personalities from the data cores were preserved.
Conversation/acObj/Line02125=The Tal'darim is brutal, but not clever. He has not discovered this data core yet, but we only have a little time remaining.
Conversation/acObj/Line02126=We can only move in secrecy for a little longer. The Tal'darim will find the data core soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02127=The enemy is targeting our data core. You must hurry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02128=Tal'darim signature detected. He's found the data core! Be swift.
Conversation/acObj/Line02129=The data core is under siege.
Conversation/acObj/Line02130=The enemy strikes our data core!
Conversation/acObj/Line02131=A data core is in danger. Action advised.
Conversation/acObj/Line02132=Security protocol failing. We have lost the facility! I shudder to think of what the rogue Tal'darim will do with it...
Conversation/acObj/Line02133=I was unable to act in time. This is the end for the facility, and all the uncorrupted personalities that remain here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02134=The rogue Tal'darim has expanded his control beyond any hope of reversal. We must abandon the facility.
Conversation/acObj/Line02135=Analyzing systems... No trace of the Tal'darim personality remains. It appears he is truly dead, at last. Fine work, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02136=The rogue personality has been eliminated from this facility. The Purifiers give you our thanks, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02137=All systems are under our control. And do not fret--we will never attempt to convert another Tal'darim warrior.
Conversation/acObj/Line02138=This one contains three personalities. Save them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02139= If you have time, please rescue the personalities within it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02140=If you could recover these personalities, the Purifiers would be grateful.
Conversation/acObj/Line02141=The Tal'darim's forces are heading our way. They appear as holographic warriors of many races--inspired by his battles in life. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02142=Stay vigilant. The Tal'darim sends his holographic warriors to your position. They may not be flesh, but they are fierce.
Conversation/acObj/Line02143=The Tal'darim has altered the holographic security forces to resemble warriors he fought when he was still alive.
Conversation/acObj/Line02146=What a relief! Another personality saved...
Conversation/acObj/Line02147=You have protected another of my brethren.
Conversation/acObj/Line02148=This personality will never be lost now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02149=This Purifier is free from harm.
Conversation/acObj/Line02150=Moebius Corps once had ties to our own emperor, Valerian Mengsk. Now they're raising hybrid to kill everyone in the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02151=I found a mech here, the Balius, that can destroy the hybrid. But first it needs parts. It's in your best interest to help me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02152=A deplorable tragedy has occurred here. Moebius Corps took over the research facility and used it to create their monstrosities. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02153=I can take them down using their own prototype mech, the Balius. Gather parts so that we can activate it, and be quick about it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02154=The emperor said that Moebius Corps is using this facility to breed alien terrors. The Dominion must exterminate them at all costs!
Conversation/acObj/Line02155=I'll have to use a mech, the Balius, to get through the hybrid's cell shields. Once you collect the parts, I'll get started.
Conversation/acObj/Line02156=We've passed the halfway point. The Balius is coming together.
Conversation/acObj/Line02157=The Balius is halfway online. Keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02158=We have half of the Balius parts now. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02159=Balius construction has nearly concluded. A small number of parts remain.
Conversation/acObj/Line02160=The Balius is almost ready, now. Just a few more parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02161=We're only a handful of parts away from rolling out.
Conversation/acObj/Line02162=You are efficient, aren't you? We're set for parts now. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02163=Well, would you look at that! We have enough parts for launch!
Conversation/acObj/Line02164=Construction material needs have been met. Your cooperation is appreciated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02165=The Balius took significant damage in that encounter. I'm gonna need more parts.
Conversation/acObj/Line02166=I'm afraid the Balius requires additional parts after that fight.
Conversation/acObj/Line02167=The Balius got beat up back there. Go gather some more parts for it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02168=Evaluating pre-launch diagnostics. This will only take a bit.
Conversation/acObj/Line02169=Combat systems are up and running. Safety tests still pending--so be patient.
Conversation/acObj/Line02170=I'm making the final preparations for the Balius' deployment. Expect to see me out there soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02171=Ready for action! I'm approaching the hybrid's containment cell.
Conversation/acObj/Line02172=This is General Davis reporting in. The Balius is en route to its target.
Conversation/acObj/Line02173=Hybrid cell identified. The Balius is headed to it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02174=I've suffered a major breach here, but I can make one final salvo.
Conversation/acObj/Line02175=Structural integrity has been compromised. This will be my last hit for now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02176=I can do one more strike, then the Balius needs to be patched up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02177=Only a technician can fix the mech now. You're on your own.
Conversation/acObj/Line02178=I'm returning for repairs now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02179=Heading back to the mechanics.
Conversation/acObj/Line02180=Containment cell down. Focus on the hybrid!
Conversation/acObj/Line02181=I've cracked the containment cell! Hybrid target acquired!
Conversation/acObj/Line02182=Cell ruptured. Open fire on the hybrid!
Conversation/acObj/Line02183=There's a mechanical failure on the Balius. Finish the hybrid without me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02184=I have to fall back for repairs. Kill the hybrid, no matter what happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line02185=The Balius can't take any more of this. I'll leave the hybrid to you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02186=I didn't think you could pull that off alone, but I'm glad to be wrong.
Conversation/acObj/Line02187=You did it, commanders. This hybrid threat has been annihilated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02188=What a relief! Nothing like a dead hybrid to calm the nerves.
Conversation/acObj/Line02189=Target down. Now I need to get the Balius back in fighting shape.
Conversation/acObj/Line02190=That hybrid's dead, but it almost took the Balius with it. I'll need to spend some time restoring it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02191=Our victory came at a price, commanders. The Balius is going to need more work.
Conversation/acObj/Line02192=All shall SUBMIT.
Conversation/acObj/Line02193=DIE.
Conversation/acObj/Line02194=Only darkness awaits you...
Conversation/acObj/Line02195=I have new intel. Moebius Corps is attempting to evacuate key research material while we're distracted with the hybrid.
Conversation/acObj/Line02196=Find their train and destroy it. That's an order.
Conversation/acObj/Line02197=Moebius Corps just doesn't give up! They're still trying to save their research, even as we gun down their prized experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line02198=Ensure their train never reaches its destination, would you?
Conversation/acObj/Line02199=I've never seen anything like Moebius Corps. We're ruining their facility, and they're still trying to smuggle their research out!
Conversation/acObj/Line02200=You'll find them on a train running across the research area. Leave none alive.
Conversation/acObj/Line02201=They're sending a second train. Intercept it!
Conversation/acObj/Line02202=My reports indicate a second train is coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line02203=Another train will pass us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02204=Do not let the train through!
Conversation/acObj/Line02205=Everyone on this train must die!
Conversation/acObj/Line02206=Launch an assault on the train!
Conversation/acObj/Line02207=Excellent. The train is wrecked, and Moebius will never get what was on it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02208=There's something about seeing Moebius trains crash and burn that is just so satisfying.
Conversation/acObj/Line02209=The train crashed, and I'm not seeing any survivors on my scans. Moebius can rot with all the evil it has perpetrated.
Conversation/acObj/Line02210=This train has nearly escaped! Pay attention!
Conversation/acObj/Line02211=Your chance to attack this train is slipping away.
Conversation/acObj/Line02212=The train will not wait for you to strike it, commander!
Conversation/acObj/Line02213=The train escaped. I see you don't care about disobeying orders...
Conversation/acObj/Line02214=There goes the train... I wonder how many innocent people will die because it got away?
Conversation/acObj/Line02215=The Moebius train has fled for now... but I will hunt them down eventually, mark my words.
Conversation/acObj/Line02216=That's right! We'll stamp out every last one of these traitors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02217=I can't say that wasn't sublimely satisfying.
Conversation/acObj/Line02218=If only all the treasonous scum could meet their fate like that.
Conversation/acObj/Line02219=So this is how humanity ends... a pity.
Conversation/acObj/Line02220=What this world needed was true defenders... We have failed it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02221=I always knew I'd die in combat--just didn't think it would be here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02222=We're rid of that alien filth! My commendations, soldiers. I'll send word of your deeds back to the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02223=Today you have proved that the human spirit will persevere, no matter how terrible the odds. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02224=You fought like hell out there. I'll remember that. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02225=Don't take all day. If these creatures don't perish, we will.
Conversation/acObj/Line02226=The hybrid's power is growing. We have to go faster!
Conversation/acObj/Line02227=Our scanners show the hybrid's making a lot of progress. So should we.
Conversation/acObj/Line02228=Moebius' victory is imminent! Move, move, move!
Conversation/acObj/Line02229=The pressure's on. We have just a few moments left to kill this hybrid bastard.
Conversation/acObj/Line02230=We're getting down to the wire. Make every minute count.
Conversation/acObj/Line02231=Our time's almost up, and this isn't the kind of place you want to die in.
Conversation/acObj/Line02232=We are on the verge of defeat. Everyone, hurry!
Conversation/acObj/Line02233=This damn alien is about to murder us all! Get moving!
Conversation/acObj/Line02234=Sometimes this really feels like a dead-end job.
Conversation/acObj/Line02235=Oh, I know what you mean. Deader than those death shards.
Conversation/acObj/Line02236=Have you ever wondered what happened to Reigel?
Conversation/acObj/Line02237=Not really. Always seemed like he knew more than he let on, though.
Conversation/acObj/Line02238=The whole battle station is going to fire! This is worse than I ever imagined...
Conversation/acObj/Line02239=We ran out of time! A whole lot of people are going to die because of this...
Conversation/acObj/Line02240=Mission failed... sending my final report to the Dominion.
Conversation/acObj/Line02241=Moebius Corps is gonna regret this day. I couldn't have done it without you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02242=Don't know what I would have done if you hadn't happened along, commanders. Thank you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02243=Mission successful! Nice job, commanders, but now I'll be forgetting all about this, and you...
Conversation/acObj/Line02244=These research outposts are transferring their data so they can build additional weapons elsewhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line02245=If you have time to escort your truck to 'em, it will disrupt the connection. Consider it a target of opportunity.
Conversation/acObj/Line02246=These research outposts started transferring their weaponry data as soon as they noticed your presence here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02247=Would you mind taking your truck over? Its artifacts will sever the connection real quick.
Conversation/acObj/Line02248=Moebius Corps knows we're here, and they're transferring their weapons data from the outposts on this battle station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02249=If have a chance, steer your truck that way. It'll corrupt the data and stop it from ever being used elsewhere.
Conversation/acObj/Line02250=A Moebius research outpost has almost finished uploading its data.
Conversation/acObj/Line02251=You'd better hustle if you wanna stop that research outpost, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02252=Moebius has almost finished sending out their research data. Stop 'em if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line02253=You'll find this sector just to the north of your position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02254=This sector is south of your current base of operations.
Conversation/acObj/Line02255=Focus on getting the trucks to the sector west of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02256=Head east, and you'll find the sector before you know it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02257=I'm trusting you to get the trucks to this sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line02258=This is the next sector. I can't wait to see it go up in flames.
Conversation/acObj/Line02259=These trucks are ready to go, commanders. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02260='Fraid we can't wait very long to move the trucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line02261=Don't forget about the trucks, all right?
Conversation/acObj/Line02262=The first truck's in place.
Conversation/acObj/Line02263=That's one truck down.
Conversation/acObj/Line02264=Now for the other truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02268=Get to safety, it's about to blow!
Conversation/acObj/Line02269=Move out of the blast radius, quickly!
Conversation/acObj/Line02270=Hurry out before it goes up in flames!
Conversation/acObj/Line02271=That sector's gone. You've bought yourselves a little more time, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02272=Well, there's nothing left of that sector. Now it'll take 'em longer to fire the battle station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02273=Demolition complete, and we've delayed them from activating the battle station's weapons.
Conversation/acObj/Line02274=Happy to say we only have three sectors left.
Conversation/acObj/Line02275=Okay, this leaves us with three more sectors to destroy.
Conversation/acObj/Line02276=You'll still need to get trucks to two more sectors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02277=There are two additional sectors to detonate.
Conversation/acObj/Line02278=Hang in there. Just one sector left. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02279=One more sector to go. We can do this!
Conversation/acObj/Line02280=Friendly reminder--we only have so long to finish off the sectors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02281=The battle station's readying its attack. We need to get going.
Conversation/acObj/Line02282=Clock's ticking, everyone!
Conversation/acObj/Line02283=Almost outta time, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02284=Move those trucks, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line02285=This is our final moment! Go!
Conversation/acObj/Line02286=Bad news, commanders. An attack wave is coming for your truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02287=Looks like Amon's minions have found your truck's location. Expect an attack soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02288=The enemy's targeting your truck's coordinates. Keep an eye out.
Conversation/acObj/Line02289=Your truck's in some trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line02290=Protect your truck!
Conversation/acObj/Line02291=The enemy's after your truck.
Conversation/acObj/Line02292=Defend your ally's truck, will ya?
Conversation/acObj/Line02293=Your friend's truck needs some help.
Conversation/acObj/Line02294=Your buddy's truck's getting beat up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02295=Got a replacement truck ready to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line02296=New truck's ready to hit the road.
Conversation/acObj/Line02297=I found another truck for ya.
Conversation/acObj/Line02298=My team scrapped together some new trucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line02299=Both of your trucks have arrived.
Conversation/acObj/Line02300=Two spare trucks have been prepped for ya.
Conversation/acObj/Line02301=Damn, your truck's gone. Don't worry, I've got more here somewhere...
Conversation/acObj/Line02302=The enemy's wrecked your truck. This is gonna take a while to fix.
Conversation/acObj/Line02303=There goes your truck! Time for the backup plan...
Conversation/acObj/Line02304=These trucks don't have cruise control. You gotta guide 'em home.
Conversation/acObj/Line02305=Did you leave a truck behind? They can't do this by themselves, you know!
Conversation/acObj/Line02306=The truck drivers won't go without your say so, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02310=The artifacts in your truck will disarm this construct--like fighting fire with fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line02311=Bring your truck full of artifacts to this construct, and it'll shut down, I promise.
Conversation/acObj/Line02312=Your truck's cargo will neutralize this construct. Just drive it over.
Conversation/acObj/Line02313=That construct's gonna cause a whole heap of trouble unless you bring a truck here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02314=Get your truck to the construct before it melts through your forces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02315=Don't wait too long to get your truck to this construct, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02316=A construct is outta control. Where's your truck?
Conversation/acObj/Line02317=Your forces are dying to a construct. Bring a truck here, quick!
Conversation/acObj/Line02318=A construct's threatening your warriors. Get a truck to them, eh?
Conversation/acObj/Line02319=Well done. The construct's down.
Conversation/acObj/Line02320=Good work. That's one less construct to deal with.
Conversation/acObj/Line02321=You did it! The construct's just rubble now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02322=Moebius Corps constructed a battle station on this platform. We're gonna have to take out each sector of it before it fires on our colonies.
Conversation/acObj/Line02323=These trucks carry xel'naga artifacts that'll destabilize Moebius' technology, but first you'll have to move them into position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02324=Moebius Corps built a battle station on this platform, and we're gonna have to dismantle it sector by sector.
Conversation/acObj/Line02325=I loaded these trucks with xel'naga artifacts that will scramble their setup. Get 'em in place before it's too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line02326=I've never seen a battle station like this. Moebius tech is something else--only xel'naga artifacts seem to affect it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02327=I've placed 'em in these trucks so they can disrupt each sector before it fires on Dominion colonies. But I'll need you to escort them.
Conversation/acObj/Line02328=Those constructs are blocking the way again. Better take care of 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line02329=What do you know... more constructs are trying to deter you. Don't let 'em succeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02330=You've got some company up ahead. Take down those constructs to access the demolition point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02331=You'll have to clear these constructs off the demolition point to get your trucks in there.
Conversation/acObj/Line02332=Those constructs are on the demolition point! Blow 'em up!
Conversation/acObj/Line02333=We didn't make it to the research outpost, but they stopped broadcasting anyway. I wonder why?
Conversation/acObj/Line02334=Huh. The research outposts seem to have had trouble getting a signal after all. Crisis averted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02335=You're not gonna believe this. The outposts just went silent. That's good... I think? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02336="Teleportation by TheSkunk and Pr0nogo." I wonder how it works?
Conversation/acObj/Line02337=Okay, Gary. You can open your eyes now. Surprise! I brought you back to Bel'shir for your birthday. This is where you were born.
Conversation/acObj/Line02338=And... uh... since we're here and my terrazine supplies are low, why don't we harvest some more? It'll be fun! I'll even let you help!
Conversation/acObj/Line02339=Here we are. Back on Bel'shir. Did you miss it as much as I did, Gary? (beat) Hey! Don't say that. Bel'shir might hear you, and we need her help to get more terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line02340=Okay. It looks like most of the old equipment is still intact. There's a lot to do and I need your help, so don't screw this up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02341=Oh great Bel'shir, your faithful servant Egon has returned. Look, I know it's been a while, but I could really use some more terrazine. Please?
Conversation/acObj/Line02342=I even brought Gary and some other friends along. They're going to help me with the harvesting. (whispering to Gary) Gary! Gary! Tell Bel'shir that you missed her!
Conversation/acObj/Line02343=Looks like a geyser's about to become active! I'll have Gary send one of the bots for it shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02344=The first geyser should be opening up soon. I'll have Gary send a bot out for it when it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02345=Ooh, I've located a soon-to-be active geyser. Gary will send a bot to harvest it, but we need to escort the little fella.
Conversation/acObj/Line02346=Bel'shir says that some more geysers are opening up soon. Don't worry if you can't hear her, Gary. If you prove yourself today, maybe she'll talk to you too.
Conversation/acObj/Line02347=Geysers are gonna be active soon. (beat, annoyed) Don't ask me how I know that, Gary. I just... do.
Conversation/acObj/Line02348=Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. Aww, this is Bel'shir saying that she missed me!
Conversation/acObj/Line02349=Some geysers are gonna be opening in a few moments. Do your happy dance, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02350=You know what I'm about to say, right, eh? That there are more geysers on the way? Get out of my head, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02351=Looks like this is the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02352=Hey! Heads up! The first bot is going out. We must protect it! It's my second favorite... after Gary, of course.
Conversation/acObj/Line02353=Okay, Gary sent a bot out to collect the geyser's terrazine. I've got my mecha-swarm on the prowl, but keep your eyes open in case you spot any bad guys!
Conversation/acObj/Line02354=My bot is departing now. The night is dark and full of terrazine, so let's make sure it comes back in one piece.
Conversation/acObj/Line02355=Bots are on their way! Let's keep them out of trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line02356=The best of my bots are going out! Well, not counting you, Gary. You're in a league of your own.
Conversation/acObj/Line02357=My bots really want to get to the terrazine. They're not as patient as you, Gary, so you can let them out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02358=Bots away! (Laughs at his own joke) What? Don't be a party pooper, Gary. Bel'shir laughs every time I tell it!
Conversation/acObj/Line02359=Look, just because these other bots aren't as perfect as Gary doesn't mean I don't love them. I'd appreciate it if you help me keep them safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02360=I think the bots are telling us they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They lied to me the last time I was here, those little miscreants!
Conversation/acObj/Line02361=There go the bots! (Sniffs) They've grown up so much since the last time I saw them! Daddy loves you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02362=Look at the bots go! They'd be even better if I upgraded them into Super Harvesters... (sigh, frustrated) but Gary will get jealous if I do that. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02363=My bot is collecting the terrazine now. Pay attention! We have to defend it until it's done.
Conversation/acObj/Line02364=Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Gary, make sure the bot does its job or I will hold you accountable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02365=They're coming after my bots! We need to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line02366=Gah, here come the bad guys! At least this time I have some new friends to say "Hello."
Conversation/acObj/Line02367=Uh oh! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line02368=The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. We CANNOT let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line02369=Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have told Gary to put more turrets on those things!
Conversation/acObj/Line02370=Sorry, bad guys, Bel'shir is closed today! You better pack it up and get outta here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02371=The harvesting bot is returning now. We'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line02372=The bot is heading back. It's scared, so we should keep it company.
Conversation/acObj/Line02373=A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely. Give it some emotional support, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02374=Come on home, little bots! Me and my friends will protect you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02375=Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I'm low on terrazine and I need a new supply... for my... experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line02376=The bots are returning now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike a CERTAIN robot companion, whom I will not name. (cough) Gary. (cough)
Conversation/acObj/Line02377=Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Let's stay close so we can keep them safe!
Conversation/acObj/Line02378=And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (beat) Don't get jealous, Gary. It's just a game. I still keep the best oil for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02379=My bots are heading back to base. We have to be careful. It's a jungle out there! Oh... it is.
Conversation/acObj/Line02380=Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! We need to do something! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02381=Good morning, friends! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast! Unless YOU want to be next, we need to do something!
Conversation/acObj/Line02382=The enemy's attacking my bots! Why didn't you warn us about this, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02383=Enemy forces have converged on my bots! I'll get my mecha-swarm in there!
Conversation/acObj/Line02384=Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them like the last time I was here!
Conversation/acObj/Line02385=My bots are under attack! And no, I am NOT hallucinating this time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02386=So, uh... everything's fine here... except for the fact that the enemy is smashing my bots to pieces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02387=Look, Gary, your brothers and sisters are back! And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02388=Good news, Gary! Our bots have brought us terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02389=The bots have returned! Even after all this time, they can still get the job done! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02390=Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet AGAIN, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line02391=Hey, friends, you hear that? Yeah, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line02392=Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots! Then I'll have to ask Gary to harvest the terrazine, and we'll get into this big argument about job responsibilities...
Conversation/acObj/Line02393=We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But it's gonna take a lot more to replace what I've already used.
Conversation/acObj/Line02394=Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to continue my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line02395=What does anyone need this much terrazine for, you ask? Science, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line02396=My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I guess she missed me...
Conversation/acObj/Line02397=Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! Ours... I mean it's all ours.
Conversation/acObj/Line02398=We've got almost all the terrazine I need... I mean, we need! Because, of course, I'll share some. (nervous laughter) Uh... let's keep it up, friends!
Conversation/acObj/Line02399=Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line02400=Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Gary, what do you think? Should we free it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02401=The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! This is a great chance to test your empathy, Gary. What would you do? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02402=They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic gliders! If we save it, Bel'shir will be very happy with us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02403=Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. What'll it be this time, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02404=Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. You think we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02405=Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. It's crying out to me for help... I think.
Conversation/acObj/Line02406=The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If we're gonna save it, we have to do it now!
Conversation/acObj/Line02407=We have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. How does the creature's impending doom make you feel, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02408=If we want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, we don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line02409=Bel'shir would appreciate it if we saved that glider. If we don't do something, she might, you know, punish us with her divine power.
Conversation/acObj/Line02410=(Mumbles calculations to himself) By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. We don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02411=The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world. We'll miss our chance if we don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02412=Well, we're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death. Are we just gonna ignore it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02413=The Bel'shir glider is almost dead. What would you do, Gary? The answer you give will probably determine whether I ever trust you again.
Conversation/acObj/Line02414=Well, the glider's dead. Gary, you don't look concerned about that AT ALL. Do I need to do another Baseline Test on you?
Conversation/acObj/Line02415=Oops. We kind of just let that thing die, didn't we? Um... but at least the terrazine supplies are filling up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02416=Well, that's one dead whale. Ah well. I can analyze the remains later and make a mechanized version of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02417=They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this... and she will direct her wrath at all of us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02418=All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! (beat) Oh, NOW you're crying, Gary? A lot of good that does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02419=We saved it! Bel'shir is very happy with us, friends. Yes, even you, Gary. I told her that you thought it was a good idea.
Conversation/acObj/Line02420=Thanks for supporting our choice to save that thing, Gary. I was getting a little worried you might be a cold, merciless psychopath. (nervous laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02421=I'm glad you're happy that we saved that thing, Gary. Now I don't have to restrain you when I sleep at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line02422=Noooo! Bel'shir will demand a sacrificial offering after wasting all that terrazine. I'm looking at you, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02423=(Sarcastic) Nice job. Real nice. All that terrazine just... gone! (beat) What? You're blaming ME, Gary? You're unbelievable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02424=Hey! Hey! Watch your mouth, Gary. That was NOT my fault... not this time, at least.
Conversation/acObj/Line02425=No, no, no! (sigh) How can I be so bad at everything I try, and still be so great?
Conversation/acObj/Line02426=Oh great Bel'shir. Thank you for this wonderful gift of terrazine. (whispering to Gary) Gary! Don't be rude. Say "thank you."
Conversation/acObj/Line02427=We did it, friends! You know what that means? (very cheerful) That's right--I don't have to disassemble Gary and build a new best friend!
Conversation/acObj/Line02428=Great work, Gary! You're really getting the hang of this. Next time maybe I'll let you control my mecha-swarm.
Conversation/acObj/Line02429=Excellent work, everyone! And didn't Gary do great? Just for that, I'm gonna build him a new friend. I'll call her Gretta! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02430=Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/acObj/Line02431=Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02432=If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Conversation/acObj/Line02433=The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Conversation/acObj/Line02434=These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Conversation/acObj/Line02435=These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line02436=Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Conversation/acObj/Line02437=Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line02438=Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Conversation/acObj/Line02439=I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line02440=Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Conversation/acObj/Line02441=Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?
Conversation/acObj/Line02442=(Sing-song voice) My bots are under attack... My bots are under attack...
Conversation/acObj/Line02443=What's made to last forever and being destroyed? My bots, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line02444=That's a good little bot! Welcome home! I missed you so much!
Conversation/acObj/Line02445=The bots are back in town, the bots are back in town! (Makes guitar noises)
Conversation/acObj/Line02446=My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02447=Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line02448=Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02449=I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line02450=Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Conversation/acObj/Line02451=Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02452=This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/acObj/Line02453=Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Conversation/acObj/Line02454=My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02455=Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Conversation/acObj/Line02456=They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Conversation/acObj/Line02457=Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02458=Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Conversation/acObj/Line02459=They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02460=It's raining zerg! Death from above! Save the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02461=The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Conversation/acObj/Line02462=Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02463=What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Conversation/acObj/Line02464=A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Conversation/acObj/Line02465=No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Conversation/acObj/Line02466=Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line02467=Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line02468=A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line02469=That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line02470=More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line02471=These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Conversation/acObj/Line02472=Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Conversation/acObj/Line02473=They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02474=The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02475=Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line02476=Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!

Conversation/acResponses/Line00801=Indeed, all data points to its elimination.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00804=Its current trajectory indicates it is attempting to flee. We will need to move quickly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00805=And it is moving quite rapidly. Our response will have to be just as swift.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00806=It is attempting to escape. We must intercept it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00807=My forces are engaging now.

Conversation/acResponses/Line00831=Understood. We shall endeavor to secure it shortly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00832=We should make ready. It will take considerable effort to hold the area once we begin.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00833=Warriors, prepare yourselves. We move for the capture point soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00836=Stand your ground. Let no enemy approach this soil.
Conversation/acResponses/Line00837=This area is claimed by the Templar. No foe shall take it from us.

Conversation/acResponses/Line01136=Maintain our support. We've got this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01137=It needs our support. Let's get moving!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01138=I won't let that happen. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01139=It's now or never. Support the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01140=Nothing to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01141=Another mission successful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01142=They underestimated us. Big mistake.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01143=Did they really think they could stop us?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01144=Looks like the enemy couldn't handle us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01145=So it's true what they say about the best offense...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01146=Looks like we've saved the day.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01147=We'll provide the escort, don't worry.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01148=You're in luck. We're the best escort around.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01149=Nothing like an armed escort to send a message.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01150=Escort established. Time to get moving.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01151=Objective is being escorted now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01152=We're moving out. Stay alert.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01153=Now that's a job well done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01154=Nice and easy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01155=That's it? And here I was thinking we were in for a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01156=Glad to help.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01157=I'm always up for scaring off some bandits.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01158=Dig your heels in, and get ready for a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01159=Establishing a defensive perimeter now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01160=Let's get everything in place. We're in for the long haul.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01161=Hold the line! We need just a little longer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01162=Do not let the enemy through! That's an order!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01163=Failure is not an option. Keep the perimeter secure!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01164=If there's one thing a sniper knows, it's how to defend her nest.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01165=It's almost time. Do not let the objective fall!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01166=(Laughs)Amon sends his little pets against me. I will tear them apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01167=The Tal'darim will crush them into dust.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01168=Ah, the icons of Amon's betrayal. I will enjoy destroying them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01169=They will be the first to know my wrath.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01170=Perhaps they will finally provide me with a challenge. But I doubt it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01171=I shall see to its destruction myself.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01172=Its obliteration will soon be at hand.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01173=The Tal'darim will ensure its demise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01174=The slaughter has begun.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01175=We have found the objective. Now we shall destroy it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01176=It won't be long before the objective crumbles.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01177=Was there ever any doubt?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01178=An inevitable outcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01179=Hardly a challenge.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01180=Perhaps now we can move on to a real fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01181=Expect nothing less of the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01182=None shall escape me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01183=I will crush them before they can scurry away.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01184=Well, it IS quite satisfying to chase down one's prey.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01185=The objective is within our grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01186=We have hunted down the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01187=The Tal'darim are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01188=Slay them at once!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01189=We've delayed long enough. Finish this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01190=You are disappointing me, supplicants.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01191=(Scoffs)Pathetic.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01192=A shameful and cowardly death.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01193=Such is the way of the Tal'darim. No prisoners. No survivors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01194=(Laughs)Was the enemy expecting mercy?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01195=All who oppose me shall suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01196=Defense is a losing strategy, but I shall seize victory nonetheless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01197=Let's see if the enemy dares to strike the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01198=This ground is now mine. The enemy will not have it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01199=The enemy falls upon my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01200=I shall lay waste to these attackers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01201=Do these fools think they can slip past me?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01202=Yes, yes, well defended. All that matters is my supremacy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01203=The best defense is unrelenting offense.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01204=Only because I willed it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01205=So ends my good deed for the day.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01206=And now you are in my debt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01207=I will seize control of it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01208=My minions will establish control over it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01209=The Tal'darim will control the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01210=The Tal'darim lay claim to this area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01211=The objective will soon be mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01212=I am assuming control of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01213=None can challenge my claim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01214=It now falls under my domain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01215=I do so enjoy conquering new territory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01216=Did the enemy really think they could withstand the Tal'darim?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01217=Now I control the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01218=The objective will belong to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01219=It cannot escape my grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01220=I will seize it for myself.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01221=I am capturing the objective as we speak.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01222=It won't be long before the objective is mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01223=The Tal'darim are taking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01224=As if the enemy could have ever stopped me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01225=As I expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01226=It was mine the moment I decided to take it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01227=Nothing is beyond the Highlord's reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01228=Another successful conquest.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01229=It will move under my command.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01230=And I suppose you expect me to be the courier.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01231=The Tal'darim will see to its transport.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01232=I'm moving the objective. None will stop me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01233=The objective advances, as do I.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01234=Transportation has begun. Do try to keep pace.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01235=Be grateful that it had me to command it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01236=Such a menial task. I was hoping for a challenge.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01237=Is that what passes for heroism to you? How utterly boring.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01238=None can stand in my way and survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01239=The Tal'darim are unstoppable.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01240=We shall see if this is worth my support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01241=Fortunately, I'm feeling generous today.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01242=You are wise to beg for my help.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01243=I'm offering you my support. See that it doesn't go to waste.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01244=The objective has my support. Victory is sure to follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01245=My support has been given. You may grovel later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01246=We will soon trample the enemy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01247=I will enjoy crushing the enemy under my heel.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01248=Enough of this little game. I will finish this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01249=If you can't win with MY support, then you are truly hopeless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01250=It seems that not even the Tal'darim can prevent you from failing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01251=Must I do everything myself?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01252=(Scoffs)Child's play.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01253=Winning is not enough. You must crush the enemy's spirit as well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01254=An inevitable outcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01255=Our foes die upon my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01256=Perhaps now you can comprehend my true power.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01257=And of course it falls on me to protect it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01258=Feel free to cower in my shadow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01259=Defense is for the meek. The Tal'darim will clear the path.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01260=The sooner we are done with this nonsense, the better.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01261=Is this truly the fastest we can move?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01262=Make haste. My blade thirsts for blood.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01263=That took much too long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01264=Couldn't you have made this journey yourself?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01265=I don't care. At least the bloodshed kept me entertained.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01266=Our enemies are almost as pathetic as you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01267=Perhaps now we can move on to an actual fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01268=I will compensate for the weaknesses on display here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01269=The Tal'darim claim the primary battle line.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01270=Am I to stand still and wait? We should take the fight to the enemy!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01271=What is taking so long?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01272=Good. I'm growing tired of this farce.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01273=A pity. There are still so many enemies to slaughter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01274=Our enemy would be wise to surrender now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01275=Let our enemies come. I will enjoy crushing them into dust.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01276=I will see it burn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01277=It won't remain intact for long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01278=My infested will tear it down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01279=My forces are attacking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01280=The objective's destruction is assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01281=It is time to crush the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01282=I will see the enemy in hell.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01283=That didn't last long, did it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01284=Dasvidanya.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01285=Is that all there was?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01286=A simple but welcome victory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01287=We will not allow it to escape.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01288=It will not get past us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01289=My forces will see to its demise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01290=The objective will soon be destroyed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01291=My forces are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01292=We will tear the objective apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01293=Do not let the objective escape!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01294=The objective must not slip through our fingers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01295=We have wasted too much time. Destroy the damn thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01296=Say goodnight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01297=Escape was never an option for them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01298=They picked the wrong fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01299=Killing a fleeing adversary. How... familiar.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01300=Reminds me of duck hunting back on Earth.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01301=We will establish a defensive perimeter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01302=Do not worry. We will kill anyone who gets close.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01303=My forces will defend the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01304=These bastards want to kill us. They will be disappointed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01305=I will kill these dogs. And then I will find a use for them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01306=Our opponents will not take this objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01307=Perhaps now the enemy understands.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01308=It is good to be the hero for a change.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01309=I suppose my infested make for good guard dogs.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01310=Such an amateur strategy. I expected better from our enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01311=The objective stands, and our enemies fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01312=We will take control of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01313=My infested will occupy the area soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01314=I will send my forces to establish control.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01315=We are taking the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01316=The objective will be ours shortly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01317=My forces are securing the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01318=We have succeeded in taking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01319=The objective has been claimed... but I will refrain from infesting it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01320=Area secured. Ah, this takes me back to my days in the UED.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01321=Our opponent hardly stood a chance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01322=My forces are... unorthodox, but effective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01323=My forces will acquire the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01324=It will be in our possession soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01325=Then it's time to move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01326=My infested are taking the objective. They are... excited.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01327=We are capturing the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01328=The objective will soon be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01329=I still know a thing or two about leading an army.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01330=Ah, we have secured the objective. Well done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01331=It is good that our goals are aligned.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01332=Our victory is assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01333=The enemy was foolish for underestimating us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01334=We will take it where it needs to go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01335=It will be transported safely.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01336=We are prepared to transport it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01337=Commencing transportation now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01338=My army is transporting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01339=We have the objective in tow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01340=Our opponent thought they could stop us. They were mistaken.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01341=Good. My forces, they grow impatient.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01342=And I used to hate it when I was ordered to transport cargo.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01343=This mission is going well. I suggest we keep it that way.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01344=So much violence for such a humble task.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01345=Well, this should certainly be interesting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01346=My infested will be close by. Reassuring, yes? <Dark chuckle>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01347=You will have the support you need.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01348=My forces are providing their support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01349=We are in range of the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01350=The objective has my support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01351=We are making progress. It won't be long now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01352=Continue pushing forward. The end is in sight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01353=My forces are endless. Our mission, not so much.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01354=Enough. Let us push back and end this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01355=If we are to die here, we will at least put up a fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01356=This cannot be how it ends. We must bolster our support!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01357=Not so easy to stand against a tide of zerg, is it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01358=Our opponent lacked the conviction that we possess.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01359=My army might be monsters, but that is what makes us strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01360=The enemy lies broken before us. I suppose I should let my infested feed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01361=Ah, Gerard would have liked to witness that one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01362=I will instruct my forces to accompany it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01363=It will move under my army's protection.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01364=My infested will provide it with an escort.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01365=My forces are in position. Time to move out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01366=The objective is now in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01367=We are moving alongside the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01368=I was once a vice admiral in the UED. This is simple by comparison.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01369=Our opponents lack a basic understanding of strategy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01370=Perhaps even the infested can serve a purpose.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01371=Of course. My troops are mindless, but they are also obedient.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01372=Death means nothing to the infested. Did the enemy think we would fear it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01373=Do not worry. I will refrain from infesting this location.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01374=Trust me, it is very difficult to rid a place of the infested.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01375=My forces will fortify this position.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01376=We will hold. It is not so easy to kill what's already dead.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01377=Maybe we die. Maybe we win. Maybe both.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01378=Our fortifications will not be breached.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01379=I have endured far worse than this. I will not be defeated.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01380=This will all be over soon, one way or another.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01381=Narud's handiwork. Destroying them will be satisfying.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01382=Mengsk was a fool to think he could control them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01383=These monsters should not exist. I will make it so.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01384=I watched them grow as I was tortured. Now I will watch them die.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01385=Amon's secret weapon. We will rid him of them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01386=These hybrid abominations must be destroyed!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01387=Amon has set loose his hybrid.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01388=Not even the hybrid can withstand our might!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01389=We shall cut through these vile hybrid!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01390=I fear no hybrid!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01391=We shall be the end of it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01392=It will not stand against us for long.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01393=My warriors will destroy it at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01394=The Purifiers are assaulting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01395=My warriors are laying the objective to waste!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01396=To battle! We attack the objective now!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01397=My warriors never falter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01398=Glory to the Daelaam!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01399=Another victory for the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01400=Hardly a match for my blades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01401=Ah, the thrill of battle!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01402=It will not escape so easily!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01403=No target is beyond our reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01404=The Purifiers will surely stop it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01405=We strike at the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01406=My forces are attacking the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01407=The objective is in our sights.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01408=We must not allow the objective to escape!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01409=The objective must fall! Redouble our efforts!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01410=Do not lose the objective! Strike it down!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01411=As expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01412=There was never a doubt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01413=None can withstand the might of the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01414=It died without a shred of honor.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01415=We are victorious!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01416=We shall be its shield.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01417=It will remain safe under our watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01418=Our enemies will die before they reach it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01419=My warriors are holding the enemy back.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01420=We are defending the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01421=The Purifiers will not allow the objective to fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01422=The Purifiers can defeat any foe!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01423=Our defenses are impenetrable!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01424=It was foolish for the enemy to challenge us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01425=Revel in our triumph!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01426=No sacrifice is too great.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01427=We shall take control of it soon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01428=My forces are prepared to mobilize.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01429=It will soon be under our control.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01430=The enemy shall not set foot here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01431=We will destroy these interlopers at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01432=This area is under our protection!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01433=Our claim is secure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01434=We claim this area in the name of the Purifiers!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01435=We have secured the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01436=The objective is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01437=Our foes never stood a chance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01438=It will soon be within our grasp.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01439=We shall acquire it without delay.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01440=My forces will set out to capture it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01441=We have taken the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01442=The objective is in our possession.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01443=The Purifiers have claimed the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01444=You bring honor to us all, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01445=Our might cannot be overcome!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01446=A glorious achievement.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01447=We have succeeded!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01448=Victory is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01449=The Purifiers will see it to its destination.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01450=We will transport it at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01451=It shall be taken where it needs to be.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01452=The objective is in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01453=My forces are transporting the objective now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01454=We have mobilized the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01455=We have delivered the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01456=Transportation successful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01457=The objective has been transported.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01458=There is no task we cannot accomplish.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01459=Well struck, warriors!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01460=We will lend our strength to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01461=Together, we shall stand as one!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01462=The Purifiers are ready to provide support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01463=My forces are with the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01464=We stand with the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01465=The objective has our support.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01466=Victory is within sight! Press on!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01467=Continue supporting the objective! This will soon be over.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01468=Push forward! Our enemies are outmatched!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01469=We will wrest victory from the jaws of defeat.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01470=Do not give in to despair. Fight to the last!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01471=Fight with valor. Die with honor.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01472=We have trampled our foes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01473=The Purifiers stand strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01474=Victory is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01475=Our enemies scatter before us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01476=In unity, we emerge triumphant.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01477=The Purifiers shall march beside it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01478=Its safety shall be assured.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01479=We will vanquish any who threaten it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01480=We are protecting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01481=No harm shall come to the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01482=The objective is under the shield of the Purifiers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01483=We have seen the objective to a safe arrival.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01484=The Purifiers serve with honor and distinction.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01485=And so our journey is complete.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01486=Noble warriors, the day is ours!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01487=Valiantly done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01488=None shall pass.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01489=Our enemies will break upon our ramparts.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01490=The Purifiers stand in defense.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01491=The battle is not yet over! Stand strong, Purifiers!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01492=Hold the line! Let none through!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01493=We shall stand eternal!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01494=Our enemies will not prevail!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01495=They shall not set foot upon this area!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01496=Hybrid essence? No use.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01497=Cannot assimilate. Must kill.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01498=They are dust. We are the wind.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01499=I will hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01500=They do not adapt. They will die.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01501=I go to destroy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01502=Kill. Maim. Destroy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01503=<acknowledging growl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01504=Near objective. Pack will strike.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01505=We fight to take the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01506=Attacking objective. Primal zerg are strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01507=Yes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01508=One dies, one grows strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01509=We evolve. We overcome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01510=No match for our claws.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01511=<triumphant roar>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01512=It flees, but we will follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01513=I hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01514=We capture.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01515=Seizing objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01516=Strike! The target will be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01517=Sink your claws into the prey, my pack.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01518=No.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01519=We are primal zerg. We pursue.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01520=Claim it as ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01521=I cannot be stopped!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01522=Not all will survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01523=It could not adapt. We could.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01524=It was ash to our fire.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01525=We are always moving, always collecting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01526=We defend.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01527=Protect this one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01528=Guard it, or suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01529=Do not let them destroy the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01530=Enemies gather, but we will protect what is ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01531=We must keep the objective secure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01532=Always.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01533=Survival is foremost.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01534=We provide.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01535=Watchful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01536=<proud snarl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01537=I savor the hunt.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01538=We capture. We collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01539=The pack will go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01540=I take what is mine.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01541=Fighting for control. We must succeed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01542=Attack. Take it now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01543=Good.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01544=<growl> Collected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01545=My pack is strong.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01546=We move closer to victory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01547=Strong essence will prevail.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01548=I will collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01549=Forward!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01550=My pack will take it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01551=Seizing objective. Those who interfere will suffer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01552=Primal zerg fight for objective. All else fades.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01553=Capturing target. We are relentless.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01554=It is ours. Prey belongs to the hunter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01555=None can tear it from our claws.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01556=I take. I collect. I grow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01557=So it will remain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01558=My pack is swift.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01559=Rise and defend.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01560=It is weak. We shall be its strength.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01561=We are the wind that drives it forth.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01562=We move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01563=Proceed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01564=Objective in motion. We are watchful.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01565=Impressive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01566=We flow as a river. Never stopping.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01567=We are a force. A wave.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01568=Test me and learn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01569=The strong survive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01570=Never doubt our strength.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01571=My pack will protect it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01572=We follow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01573=We approach the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01574=Guarding objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01575=My pack watches over the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01576=We thrive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01577=Enemies fall. Primal zerg rise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01578=Triumph in reach.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01579=Find strength, then victory. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01580=We cannot fall like leaves. We must hold.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01581=Send warriors. My pack is weak.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01582=This is the law of survival.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01583=You are impressed, no?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01584=Our essence is strong. Even more than expected.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01585=We break our enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01586=There was no other path.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01587=We go. We protect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01588=I see. I will guide it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01589=It is weak, but my pack is not.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01590=Battle is upon us!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01591=We guard with claws and fangs.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01592=My pack escorts the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01593=Secure, for now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01594=Adversity begets change.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01595=We have come far. But we must go further.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01596=My pack is large. Well-adapted.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01597=We advance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01598=Primal zerg are ready.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01599=Yes, as One-who-collects.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01600=I will kill enemies and take their essence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01601=I wait. I watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01602=Primal zerg will triumph.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01603=Pleasing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01604=Fight until none are left to collect.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01605=<satisfied growl>
Conversation/acResponses/Line01606=Sounds like a problem explosives can solve.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01607=We'll blast it to bits.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01608=I'll prepare countermeasures.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01609=We've killed them before, and we'll do it again.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01610=Everywhere we go, there they are.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01611=Hmph. That's all?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01612=I could blow that up in my sleep. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01613=I'm gonna need your help with this one, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01614=I'll get this demolition started.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01615=Heading for the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01616=Moving out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01617=Boom!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01618=Beautiful, isn't it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01619=This is what I do.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01620=Sometimes your destructive power impresses even me, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01621=Are we done yet?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01622=It is fast, but not faster than us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01623=Let's get this over with.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01624=I think we can manage this, Mira. 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01625=I am tracking down the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01626=I'm going to mess with this target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01627=Setting a course for the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01628=No one escapes me!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01629=If I can't get out of here, then it can't either.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01630=Not on my watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01631=Hah. That was charming.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01632=There is nothing we cannot do, husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01633=And beautifully so.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01634=One step closer to the end of this fight...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01635=Well, this isn't all bad.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01636=I only defend Matthew, usually. But I'll make an exception.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01637=I'll keep it as safe as I can with a crazed mercenary by my side.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01638=I'll do my best to protect it. Especially from Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01639=I am protecting the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01640=Setting up my defenses now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01641=Beginning defensive maneuvers.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01642=Nothing can defeat the power of love.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01643=I will expect a generous payment for this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01644=I guess that was worth it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01645=That went better than I thought.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01646=If it comes down to it, we can work together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01647=And I am ready to blow up my enemies.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01648=Then there is no reason to hesitate!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01649=No use waiting around, is there, Mira?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01650=I'm going to have a little fun.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01651=My forces are securing the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01652=Capturing the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01653=It's mine, all mine...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01654=I like taking things that don't belong to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01655=Leave it to a mercenary...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01656=Nicely done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01657=Maybe there was no reason to worry.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01658=It will be ours.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01659=We'll ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01660=All right. I think we can make the best of this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01661=I'm taking what is mine!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01662=Time to pick up a little something special.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01663=Capture expedition underway.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01664=Good. Otherwise I'd be very upset.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01665=Isn't it wonderful, Matthew?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01666=Another one down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01667=Not everything about this situation is a failure.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01668=I'll give you this, Mira. You're good at taking things.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01669=Hah, too easy. Have you seen my ship?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01670=Let's enjoy these precious moments together, husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01671=And I'm ready to get this done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01672=The objective is all mine. Moving it now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01673=Getting this objective in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01674=This objective's on the move. Our enemies will probably take notice.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01675=I aim to please... 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01676=I'd do it all again for more time with my husband.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01677=You can thank me later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01678=Just doing my job.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01679=Isn't that a nice surprise.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01680=Not my specialty, but I will cooperate this time.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01681=We'll do what we have to.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01682=Orders received.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01683=We are securing this thing one way or another.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01684=My crew is taking a protective formation around the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01685=Whatever happens, we'll defend this from the enemy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01686=Keep going like this, and Matthew and I can finally enjoy our honeymoon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01687=Good work. We're almost there.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01688=We're making good progress. Keep it coming.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01689=Mira's Marauders do not fail!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01690=Well, you like it rough, don't you, Matthew? 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01691=This isn't a best-case scenario... but we have to try!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01692=My reputation demands no less.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01693=Of course it did. My crew gets the job done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01694=Well, what do you know...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01695=At least we're somewhat effective together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01696=I guess I've seen worse partnerships...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01697=First we work, then we play--right, darling?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01698=Whatever gets my mind off this situation is fine by me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01699=The things I do for the Dominion...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01700=Enough waiting! I'll get this objective in motion.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01701=The objective is blasting along like my best explosives.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01702=I'm getting this convoy underway.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01703=Wonderful. Matthew and I will finally have some alone time.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01704=What can I say? We are very good together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01705=I can't believe this is working.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01706=I guess our long, sordid history is good for something, Mira.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01707=Sometimes I can't tell if I have the worst luck or the best.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01708=With Matthew on my side, I hardly need to prepare at all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01709=Preparation is overrated. Spontaneity wins wars.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01710=If everything goes to plan, we might just manage.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01711=Don't try anything funny unless you really want to test my patience.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01712=Hold a little longer, and there is enough reward for all of us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01713=No use giving up now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01714=We've fought too long to lose ground here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01715=Everyone's relying on us. We can't let them down.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01716=Hybrid? Damn, you really outdid yourselves.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01717=Let's bust it open.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01718=I'll get the demo squad together.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01719=It's party time. I'm heading for the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01720=What'd y'all expect?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01721=Eyes open! We got ourselves a live one.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01722=I'm gonna get real nice and cozy with this target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01723=Oh hell no.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01724=Sure do hope they said their goodbyes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01725=I'll get the babysitters.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01726=Defensive forces going in.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01727=Heheh, hot damn, we are good!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01728=You heard 'em. Let's go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01729=Locking down the area.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01730=We're not just good--we're good-lookin' also, heh.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01731=Can't wait to get my mitts on it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01732=Rest easy. We got the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01733=Tell me something I don't know.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01734=What do I look like, a shipping company?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01735=We're nudging the objective along, real careful-like.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01736=Ain't that sweet.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01737=Keep this puppy safe... or else.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01738=We're on guard duty now, amigos.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01739=I love it when you sweet talk me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01740=Pull it together, boys and girls!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01741=Aw, you're gonna make me blush.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01742=Great. I love babysitting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01743=Convoy rolling out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01744=Yeah. Now can I get a little respect around here?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01745=No problem. Just don't tell me the odds.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01746=It's gonna get rougher before it gets smoother.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01747=Aw, you didn't tell me your mama was comin'.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01748=Time to kill some ugly sons of... whatever they are.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01749=Hope y'all have strong stomachs, heh.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01750=They are in for a world of pain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01751=Can't wait to rip it apart.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01752=The Heaven's Devils are moving in to attack. Try not to get too excited.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01753=We're going to strike the objective. Just sit back and watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01754=You get what you deserve.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01755=I noticed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01756=Yeah, yeah. Tell me about it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01757=And you thought you couldn't trust me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01758=Stay frosty. It's on the move.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01759=Why's it gotta run away like that?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01760=The Devils are going after the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01761=I'm in hot pursuit of the target.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01762=No chance of that.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01763=Enough messin' around.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01764=Damn straight it was.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01765=Heaven's Devils style!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01766=Love it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01767=No one pisses us off.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01768=Looks like we gotta defend this bad boy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01769=All we gotta do is keep it in one piece.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01770=We're protecting the objective. Thank us later.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01771=The Devils are shielding the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01772=Hah! That is the way you do it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01773=You can tell me how great I am later... or now, if you'd like.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01774=I'd do a little dance, but I'm busy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01775=Now THAT's an ass-kicking!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01776=I ain't gonna stand on ceremony here.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01777=That's fine. I hate waiting.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01778=The Devils are holding their ground.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01779=We're right on the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01780=I should be paid more.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01781=And I didn't even have to break out the extra special stimpacks...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01782=Yeah, I'm impressed too.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01783=Keep it up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01784=And I'm feelin' antsy. Let's do this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01785=Yeah, yeah, I hear ya. Gettin' a move on.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01786=The objective's mine, and I don't share well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01787=See that objective? I'm gonna nab it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01788=I'm ready for my pay out.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01789=Ab-so-lutely.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01790=Not bad at all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01791=Good ol' Tychus does it again.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01792=Sounds easy. Maybe too easy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01793=Lucky for you, the Devils are on it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01794=Giving the objective a little ol' push out the door.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01795=Transporting the objective, pronto.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01796=It's hard work being this good.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01797=Have I ever disappointed ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01798=What a purty picture.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01799=Watch and learn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01800=Anything's possible--for the right price.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01801=The Heaven's Devils have it covered.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01802=Securing the objective, 'cause I didn't have anything better to do today.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01803=Let's defend this damn thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01804=Stay cool. We're almost there.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01805=Keep your shirt on--we're nearly done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01806=Y'all don't wanna see me lose my temper, do ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01807=Failure? Never heard the word.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01808=Yeah, you're welcome, cupcake.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01809=No trouble at all...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01810=I'm sure there's more where that came from.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01811=All thanks to me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01812=We'll keep it real safe and sound, partner.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01813=Who picks these jobs, anyway?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01814=The Devils are moving out with the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01815=My gang's got the objective truckin' along.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01816=Just earnin' my keep.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01817=Talk it up a little bit more, would ya?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01818=I wish the original Devils could see this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01819=Nice job, everyone.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01820=Make yourselves comfortable. We gonna be here a good while.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01821=Hope y'all like being punching bags.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01822=And I am nearing the end of my patience!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01823=This is where they'll really try to screw us over, ain't it?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01824=Whaddaya know. We might just survive this thing.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01825=Don't drop the ball now, Devils. We almost got this!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01826=These abominations must be slain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01827=We will return them to the Void.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01828=They are a threat to us all. We will end them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01829=Amon will stop at nothing to subjugate us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01830=From the shadows they shall fall.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01831=We will not suffer its presence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01832=It shall be obliterated.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01833=And I will see that it is destroyed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01834=Our strike commences!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01835=My warriors are beginning the attack.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01836=The battle is underway.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01837=As it must be.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01838=Yet our foes have learned little.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01839=We will turn the tides of fate.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01840=As long as our minds are clear, we can prevail.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01841=Our blades will carve the way forward.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01842=They mean to escape, but it shall not be.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01843=We will thwart their evacuation.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01844=They cannot run from the shadows!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01845=My warriors are engaging the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01846=We will wait no longer to strike the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01847=I have opened the attack against the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01848=I will make amends with haste.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01849=I cannot allow this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01850=We must use our time well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01851=As I had hoped.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01852=So suffer the enemies of the Nerazim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01853=Perhaps now we will have a moment's peace.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01854=Vigilance is always rewarded.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01855=I knew it could be done.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01856=Fear not. We shall safeguard it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01857=I will defend it with my life.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01858=It shall remain under the mantle of our protection.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01859=It falls to me to reprimand these foes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01860=My forces are shielding the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01861=We have clashed with the enemy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01862=We have answered our call.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01863=Wars are won through persistence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01864=Our wisdom is a strength that cannot be seen.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01865=Well done, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01866=I must admit, I am pleased by this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01867=Then we shall not delay.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01868=We have no choice but to seize it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01869=I will see to the final preparations.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01870=Warriors, this is our chance. Enter the fray!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01871=We are laying claim to the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01872=Our contest for the objective begins.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01873=A worthwhile struggle, indeed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01874=The shadows surround all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01875=Such is the will of fate.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01876=Our foes do not comprehend our determination.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01877=We stood strong, but we did not stand alone.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01878=I understand what I must do.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01879=Remember this--we have to be prepared for anything.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01880=We shall endeavor to succeed as quickly and quietly as we can.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01881=We are attempting to control the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01882=Be vigilant. I am taking the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01883=My warriors are pressing their claim.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01884=Despite the odds, we shall advance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01885=Savor this taste of victory.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01886=My thanks to all of my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01887=Many underestimate us, but still we thrive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01888=We press forward, no matter the obstacle.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01889=We will see it delivered safely.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01890=I shall ensure that it reaches a secure location.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01891=Ready yourselves, my warriors. We must move it with care.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01892=Initiating transport now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01893=My warriors are moving the transport.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01894=We are bringing the transport forth.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01895=We have guarded it well.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01896=A fortuitous resolution.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01897=Our discipline has been its shield.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01898=Another step closer to destiny.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01899=Our cooperation has proved worthwhile.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01900=We will not fail it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01901=A noble cause for my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01902=Then there is no room for error.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01903=My forces lend their support to the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01904=We stand guard over the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01905=This objective is now under my watch.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01906=Maintain your focus, and we will see it through.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01907=Fight on! The enemy cannot stop us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01908=Our foes have faltered, but we will not!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01909=This is the time where our valor must match our hopes, warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01910=Draw deep from within, and you will best this challenge.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01911=That is not a possibility that we can consider.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01912=My faith was not misplaced.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01913=Very good. Although there will be more trials to test us...
Conversation/acResponses/Line01914=I must say, I am relieved.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01915=I will see that it reaches its destination quickly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01916=We must guide it with the utmost attention.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01917=This shall be our burden to bear.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01918=Our journey begins. We face the enemy now!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01919=My warriors are escorting the objective. May it remain safe.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01920=The objective is moving, swift as a shadow.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01921=Our alliance is forged to last.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01922=May this turn the battle in our favor.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01923=Not every endeavor ends in victory. We must honor this deed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01924=I commend your prowess, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01925=Do not believe blindly in triumph but believe in the chance of it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01926=No difficulty can deter us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01927=We will ensure its protection at any cost.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01928=Our enemies gather. We must make ready.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01929=We need only be patient for a short while longer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01930=Fight with the fury of the shadows, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01931=Let our blades strike true!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01932=We have held so far. We will not stray from this path!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01933=Deliver the enemy to the cold darkness of the Void! 
Conversation/acResponses/Line01934=Even if it is not always easy, this is the path we must tread.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01935=You have steadfast hearts, my warriors.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01936=I can't wait to study those hybrid. Um, after we kill them, of course.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01937=Look at those hybrid. Aren't they beautiful?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01938=I made a hybrid named Sherman, but Gary got jealous and ate him.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01939=No, hybrids! No! You cannot eat my army!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01940=Sally forth, servants of Bel'shir! It's time for a little hybrid hunting!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01941=Either the terrazine is really messing with me today or that's a hybrid.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01942=Smash it to pieces, mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01943=There it is, little buddies. Erase it from existence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01944=The speed boost will get us there in a jiffy!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01945=No mercy, little buddies! No mercy!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01946=Into the breach, mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01947=My robo-friends are fighting! We should keep them healed up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01948=Is there anything my buddies can't do?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01949=Well done, robo-friends. Now come give your benevolent creator a hug!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01950=You scrappy little go-getters make me so happy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01951=The servants of Bel'shir are unstoppable!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01952=My mecha-swarm will conquer all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01953=They can't run from my speedy robo-buddies. No one can.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01954=Get 'em, mecha-swarm! Get 'em!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01955=Not so fast. I promised my little friends blood, and I keep my promises.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01956=There go the mecha-swarm. They REALLY want that objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01957=My little buddies can't wait any longer!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01958=My robo-friends are going for the objective! let's keep them patched up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01959=A speed boost would really help right now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01960=Robo-friends... you know what happens when you fail me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01961=Time's running out! Do not fail me, mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01962=My little pals can do anything... because I made them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01963=The enemy must be crazy to think they can beat my mecha-swarm.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01964=Whew. After that my robo-friends really need a nap.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01965=Shh. You hear that? The mecha-swarm is humming a victory song.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01966=I never doubted the servants of Bel'shir!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01967=Don't worry. My little buddies will protect it... or I will punish them.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01968=Guard protocol engaged.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01969=Let's go, robo-friends. Just don't eat the objective this time.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01970=These jerks will be very sorry they messed with my mecha-swarm.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01971=Protect the objective, little buddies, or I will demote you to robo-interns!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01972=My robo-pals can handle this as long as we keep them patched up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01973=My little buddies did it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01974=Nicely done! Nicely done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01975=Great! Now I won't make a new throne out of your spare parts.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01976=The servants of Bel'shir... are... invincible! (maniacal laughter)
Conversation/acResponses/Line01977=Ha! My robo-pals performed even better than my simulations predicted!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01978=No rest for the mecha-swarm, huh?
Conversation/acResponses/Line01979=Time to make your creator proud out there, little buddies!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01980=Let's show the world how amazing you are, robo-friends!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01981=Hands off, bad guys! That is our objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01982=Give it your all, little buddies! We'll keep you patched up!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01983=Okay, robo-friends. I want that objective... and I want it now.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01984=Did anyone really doubt us? (beat) Shut up, Gary. I didn't ask you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01985=Behold the fate of all who stand against the servants of Bel'shir.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01986=We did it? Hah! We did it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01987=The bad guys never stood a chance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01988=We're unstoppable. We could conquer the entire galaxy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01989=Mecha-swarm... you know what to do.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01990=Wakey wakey, little buddies. Time to be awesome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01991=We'll get this done before you can say terrazine-induced psychosis.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01992=My mecha-swarm is going after the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01993=Heads up! My little buddies are going in!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01994=Look, look! My robo-friends are being incredible again!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01995=You can always count on my little buddies when you need them!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01996=Chalk up another win for my mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acResponses/Line01997=Thank you, robo-friends. I'm so proud of you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01998=Take a breather, little pals. You earned it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line01999=According to my calculations... yeah... we are awesome.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02000=Listen up, little buddies: if you break it, I will break you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02001=The servants of Bel'shir will get it where it needs to go.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02002=Get ready, robo-friends. I don't want any accidents like last time!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02003=Sit tight! The objective is on the move!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02004=Super awesome robo-caravan on the way!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02005=My little friends are moving the objective, but they're getting kind of antsy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02006=Safe and sound, just like the voice in my head promised.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02007=Hey, not bad. We should work together more often.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02008=Man, that was hard work. I need a terrazine break.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02009=I knew we could do it. No you didn't. Shut up, Egon.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02010=My little buddies can do anything when they put their processors to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02011=A speed boost will get us there in the blink of an eye.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02012=My robo-friends could do this in their sleep.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02013=Little buddies, no pressure, but... do not mess this up.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02014=Okay, little buddies... time to kill them all.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02015=We'll keep you patched up, robo-friends. Take no prisoners!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02016=Destroy them, servants of Bel'shir. Just, uh, be careful out there.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02017=Don't let up or I will feed you to Gary!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02018=We've almost got this!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02019=The bad guys are losing!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02020=Fight harder or I will snap my fingers. You know what that means.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02021=Miracle protocol engaged. Let's turn this around!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02022=Work harder, you rusty hunks of scrap!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02023=Ha ha! I knew we'd pull through!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02024=See, Gary. Told you we could do it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02025=That went exactly as planned. Exactly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02026=My little buddies will guard it with their lives. Yes. They are alive.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02027=We've got this. Just keep an eye out for the bad guys.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02028=You picked the right terrazine-enhanced scientist for the job.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02029=Don't let these jerks near the objective!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02030=Keep it safe, robo-friends! Your lives depend on it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02031=Don't panic... just keep the objective moving.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02032=Ha! In your face, bad guys!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02033=You know, it's moments like these when I realize what a genius I am.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02034=Bel'shir is going to be so proud when I tell her about this.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02035=The mecha-swarm reigns supreme.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02036=Can anything stop us? (beat) Quiet, Gary! Don't spoil the moment.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02037=Okay, little buddies. Get there fast and we'll have the advantage.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02038=That poor defenseless objective needs us. We have to protect it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02039=The bad guys are on the move. We cannot let them win.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02040=Hang in there! We've almost got it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02041=Stay strong, servants of Bel'shir! We're almost done!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02042=We're so close! Do not screw this up, little buddies!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02043=Fight harder! There is no place for weakness in my mecha-swarm!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02044=What a misuse of a monster.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02045=Understood. Remove the hybrid on my authority.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02046=I knew they'd eventually wriggle out into the light.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02047=In the eyes of your emperor there is no greater threat.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02048=Eliminate them--that is your first priority.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02049=We'll take it off the board.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02050=I expect limited casualties.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02051=Move out at once.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02052=Attack's begun. I know you're on your way.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02053=Show me you're committed to this partnership.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02054=The battle is joined. Eyes on the front.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02055=It's done. Next crisis.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02056=We're tightening our grip.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02057=One step closer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02058=These little accomplishments multiply.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02059=A battle won. Not a war.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02060=Where can they flee that I cannot reach?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02061=There'll be hell to pay if it escapes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02062=Good. Concentrate.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02063=Commencing our attack. I assume we're synchronized.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02064=I've ordered an assault on the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02065=Attacking now. Hold up your end of the bargain.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02066=Will you let that happen?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02067=This is the moment: victory, or ignominious defeat.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02068=Turn this into an opportunity.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02069=We will undermine them at every turn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02070=Competent.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02071=I alone guarantee our success.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02072=Every one of you bought this with blood.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02073=Our position is more secure by the second.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02074=Advance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02075=Now ensure that it's safe.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02076=Fortify it at the first opportunity.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02077=If they break through, we're undone.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02078=The preservation of our freedoms exacts a heavy toll.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02079=Our enemies are everywhere. Where are you?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02080=Cast them down!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02081=We've held. Think not on the cost.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02082=The price of failure was unthinkable.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02083=Did they expect us to just give it over?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02084=As tends to happen when capable individuals are involved.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02085=A praiseworthy effort.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02086=If we lose here, how can we prevail when the stakes are higher?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02087=This is more crucial than you think.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02088=The gauntlet is thrown.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02089=Repel them. Accept no surrender.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02090=We're meeting resistance. Keep the objective in view.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02091=They're pushing back. Prove yourselves.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02092=Now let's hear the skeptics chatter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02093=What other outcome did you imagine?
Conversation/acResponses/Line02094=Another example of everything I have to offer.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02095=Love for the Dominion guided you.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02096=You stuck your hand in the lion's mouth, and you'll do it again.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02097=Protect one another during this operation.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02098=Contain the objective and move on.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02099=Do not disappoint me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02100=We're engaging the enemy. I'll worry about the particulars.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02101=My focus is the objective.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02102=Carry your weight, or be left behind.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02103=Decidedly.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02104=A little strife has been good for us.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02105=My trust was well-placed.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02106=Gaining ground only matters if we win.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02107=As I anticipated.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02108=Good. Tend to it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02109=That's your cue to act.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02110=No further delays.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02111=Protecting the objective is your sole duty.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02112=No mistakes. We can always find more hands.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02113=That transport can not be replaced.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02114=Few responsibilities have been so great.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02115=Our enemies are legion, and yet we persevere.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02116=Indeed. But it could have been faster.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02117=Tolerance for risk was our primary asset.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02118=I will not be stopped.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02119=The linchpin, at last.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02120=Now is the hour of our ascent.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02121=Hold nothing back and nothing sacred.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02122=Treat this fight with the importance it deserves.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02123=Give them no quarter.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02124=We've put our hands on the scale. Now it's your turn.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02125=Our greatness lies in our resolve.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02126=I promised I would watch over you, and I have.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02127=Carry out your orders. Finish it!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02128=And failure is disobedience.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02129=Fix. This.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02130=You're making a mockery of our potential.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02131=Lies and misinformation! Continue the fight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02132=Nothing worth having comes easy.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02133=And they thought they'd be standing on our necks.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02134=I had every confidence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02135=Keep it moving. No mistakes.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02136=It will make the journey. You have my word.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02137=Every moment we waste is another arrow in their quiver.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02138=We're on the defensive. Throw them back!
Conversation/acResponses/Line02139=Mind all the flies buzzing around.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02140=Stop them from interfering.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02141=You sound surprised. (frequency tuning) Replace this adjutant immediately.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02142=Look for the lesson in a victory if you want to repeat it.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02143=Remember all that we can achieve with the proper guidance.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02144=Now the real work begins.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02145=Somehow, they'll find a way to hold this against me.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02146=A purpose most vital.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02147=Our goal is in sight.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02148=No one is to be caught unawares.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02149=Do not waver.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02150=The throne depends on your excellence.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02151=Hold fast. A thread breaks where it's thin.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02152=To give up now would be treasonous.
Conversation/acResponses/Line02153=Rise to the level of your calling.
