Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00027=Putting up a command center.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00028=Can't reach that.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00029=Looks like we're facing some protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00030=Well, looks like our enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00031=We've got zerg over here!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00032=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00033=Well, there's some familiar terran designs.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00034=Looks like a zerg building.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00035=Looks like we've found a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00036=Bad guys, straight ahead.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00037=What the hell is this building doing all the way out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00038=We march forth.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00039=Understood. Our warriors move.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00040=We require more warriors. We shall attack once ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00041=None shall pass.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00042=We will defend once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00043=We move for victory!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00044=We must retreat!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00045=The attack will commence once our warriors have warped in.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00046=I am in command.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00047=The enemy has cloaked! We require detection!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00048=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00049=Our scouts are headed to this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00050=Our scouting party returns.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00051=Our scouts will head to this location as soon as they can.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00052=Our scout is unable to reach this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00053=Our scout has been destroyed! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00054=An observer is on its way.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00055=Our detector must return to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00056=We are warping in a detector, immediately.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00057=Our detector has been slain! We are sending another!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00058=This location is ideal for our expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00059=Expansion secured. We are warping in a Nexus now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00060=Our forces cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00061=Our enemy is Protoss.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00062=We have encountered enemy terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00063=Hostile zerg have shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00064=We have encountered an enemy Protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00065=This building belongs to the terrans.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00066=This building bears the tainted flesh of the zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00067=The enemy's base has been discovered.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00068=We have encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00069=Leave nothing behind!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00070=I'm not ready. We'll attack once I've morphed enough zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00071=We'll have a surprise in store for them.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00072=My army isn't large enough. I'll defend as soon as I'm able.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00073=We are probing the enemy for weakness.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00074=The Swarm is returning to base. We're taking too many losses.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00075=Now we do things my way.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00076=The enemy can cloak!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00077=Our forces are under attack!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00078=So the protoss wish to do battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00079=The enemy is terran.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00080=An enemy brood wishes to challenge us?
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00081=I agree. We will begin the attack once my army is ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00082=We've encountered a protoss structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00083=There's an enemy zerg hive cluster around here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00084=We've discovered the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00085=We've encountered the enemy!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00086=Why would they build this structure out here?
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00087=Our scout is on the move.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00088=We've scouted the area. I'm taking my scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00089=My scout cannot reach that location.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00090=Give me a moment. I'll scout as soon as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00091=They killed my scout! I'm sending another.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00092=I require detection for other purposes.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00093=It's time to find out what's really going on.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00094=I'm morphing as quickly as I can.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00095=They've killed the detector! I'm sending another.

Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00101=My boys are training right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00102=You can count on us.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00103=Heading out, and playing it cool.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00104=Encountering some tough resistance.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00105=My guys are headed back to base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00106=We're heading back.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00107=I'm ordering an attack here!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00108=Let's ruffle their feathers a bit!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00109=It's a little too crazy out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00110=Alright Raiders, back under my command.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00111=Time to get back to business.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00112=Done scouting.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00113=All done here. I'll take that scout back.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00114=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00115=Scout's on the way.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00116=My scout can't get there.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00117=You got a teleporter? Otherwise, we ain't getting there.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00118=Not happenin'.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00119=Looks like my scout's wrapping things up.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00120=Yeah, that's not happenin' right now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00121=Great... Scout's dead.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00122=They got my scout!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00123=Get that command center built.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00124=Not gonna be able to pull that one off.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00125=Alright, I'm taking an expansion.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00126=Build a raven, boys. Pronto.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00127=They busted my raven!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00128=Raven heading out.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00129=I'm gonna have to say no for now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00130=Their base is over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00131=Kinda far out for a building, don't ya think?
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00132=And that would be the base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00133=Well, what do we have here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00134=Ran into an enemy base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00135=Looks like the bad guys have set up shop here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00136=That's one way to find the enemy.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00137=Looks like the enemy's shown themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00138=That's a zerg structure.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00139=Terran building sighted, and it ain't one of mine.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00140=We've found a protoss structure over here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00141=Well, there's definitely enemy protoss out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00142=There's some hostile terrans out here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00143=Aw man, zerg.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00144=The protoss are looking for a fight.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00145=Terrans... Kill them.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00146=These zerg need to be reminded who their queen is.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00147=That's a protoss building.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00148=This building is terran in origin.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00149=This structure belongs to an enemy brood.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00150=The enemy's base is here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00151=Our enemy is headquartered here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00152=There. Our foe's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00153=Here. We've found the enemy's base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00154=Strange. This structure doesn't belong here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00155=This base belongs to our foes.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00156=The enemy's forces have presented themselves.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00157=The enemy. Good, I was getting bored.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00158=The Swarm is assaulting here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00159=The Swarm spares no one!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00160=My forces are not ready yet.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00161=Let them come.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00162=The enemy will regret coming here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00163=Curious, this building is far from a base.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00164=My forces need time to prepare.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00165=My brood is engaging here.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00166=Slay them all! No quarter!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00167=We must return to the hive cluster.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00168=We're pulling back.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00169=I am morphing more zerg. We will attack when ready.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00170=Extending control.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00171=The Swarm is mine once again.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00172=We need detection.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00173=We are being overwhelmed!
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00174=Where are the reinforcements?
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00175=Sending a scout now.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00176=We concur. Our forces are en route.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00178=Our warriors are being readied.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00179=Here, we make our stand.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00180=We require additional warriors.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00181=Our forces will assault this location.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00182=We cannot survive this battle.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00183=Our warriors must pull back.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00184=This fight is lost. We retreat.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00185=We will require additional troops.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00186=I am resuming control.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00187=We have lost the enemy. Detection is required.
Conversation/AICommunication/LOTVLine00188=We require reinforcement.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVGroup00001=Story So Far Cutscene
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00001=For nearly 300 years, humans thought they were alone in Koprulu sector.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00002=The zerg emerged, seeking to consume all in their path.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00003=And before long, the protoss, a highly advanced alien race, began wiping out infested worlds, burning zerg and terran alike. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00004=A three-way war... unlike anything humanity had ever faced...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00006=Marshal Jim Raynor vowed to oppose the corrupt dictator Arcturus Mengsk for the betrayal of the woman he loved... Sarah Kerrigan.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00010=Kerrigan, a loyal operative, was left to die at the hands of the zerg.

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00012=They transformed her... and unleashed her psionic power upon the Koprulu Sector...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00013=...searching for their real objective...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00014=The protoss were unaware of this danger... and slow to respond.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00015=Their rulers, the Conclave, had dispatched Executor Artanis to hunt for Tassadar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00016=...a commander who had refused to wipe out infested terran worlds.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00017=They crossed paths with a dark templar mystic, whose kind was considered heretics by the Conclave.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00018=Through great effort, Zeratul convinced Tassadar and Artanis that he was not their enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00019=Together they rallied more protoss from both factions against the zerg.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00020=Despite the Conclave's fury, they achieved significant victories against the Swarm.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00021=But when Zeratul struck down one of the Overmind's Cerebrates...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00022=From his thoughts, the Overmind gleaned Aiur's true location...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00023=...and the Swarm descended upon the protoss homeworld...

Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00025=Using the power of both the templar and the dark templar...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00026=Aiur was lost
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00027=Old prejudices were set aside.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00028=Without the Overmind, the swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00029=Kerrigan sought control of all the zerg...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00030=Once her rule was uncontested...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00031=The zerg stood unchallenged, but to the relief of all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00032=Zeratul suspected the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00033=He uncovered prophecies stating that an ancient entity, Amon...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00034=And that this evil might already have control...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00035=It was during this time that Executor Artanis, hailed as a hero...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00036=As Hierarch, Artanis united both factions...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00037=But such unity is only a dream for Jim Raynor.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00038=Mengsk still rules, and Raynor's small rebellion has counted for nothing against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00039=Perhaps... it is time for a new strategy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00040=Raynor had vowed to see Kerrigan dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00041=Even his rebellion against Mengsk's tyranny...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00042=But with the arrival of old friends, and mysterious new allies...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00043=...scoring major victories on multiple fronts.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00044=But Zeratul warned him about the encroaching darkness...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00045=...was the Queen of Blades. She was needed alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00046=In a daring raid on the zerg homeworld of Char...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00047=...used an ancient xel'naga artifact to neutralize Kerrigan's power...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00048=The Queen of Blades was helpless.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00049=Jim?
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00050=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00051=Without a leader, the Swarm fractured.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00052=Raynor and Kerrigan found sanctuary with Valerian Mengsk...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00053=Valerian Mengsk offered them sanctuary... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00054=During the raid, Kerrigan and Raynor were separated. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00055=...He was briefly interrogated, and summarily executed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00056=Kerrigan sought vengeance.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00057=With Zeratul's guidance, Kerrigan gathered the zerg broods...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00058=The killing will never stop until Mengsk is dead.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00059=Kerrigan began dismantling the Dominion's military...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00060=To her surprise... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00061=She charted a course to Korhal, Mengsk's stronghold. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00062=But there was little time to celebrate.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00063=Raynor and Valerian Mengsk set about reforming the Dominion... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00064=With the zerg and terrans quelled...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00065=He declared that the unified protoss...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00066=Any dissenting voices went unheard amid the hope for reclamation.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00067=Zeratul set off alone, searching for the truth...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00068=They were wrong.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00069=...erupted almost overnight.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00070=The protoss homeworld of Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00071=...with all their might and fury.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00072=...but Artanis led the survivors to the dark templar's homeworld of Shakuras.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00073=The templar were now in the dark templar's debt.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00074=...even enlisting the aid of old friends and enemies like Raynor, Mengsk, and Zeratul.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00075=The Queen of Blades betrayed them all...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00076=Billions of humans and protoss were killed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00077=He sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00078=...his own mind was left vulnerable.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00079=The war seemed to end there.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00080=...was attempting to merge protoss and zerg life forms into an unholy hybrid.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00081=...of Kerrigan and her power.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00082=...was made leader of both the templar and the dark templar.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00083=...and promised to one day reclaim the glory they had lost on Aiur.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00084=But his retaliatory strike failed.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00085=...proved ineffective against the Dominion's propaganda machine. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00086=Raynor revived his campaign against the Dominion...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00087=...and said the key to stopping Amon... 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00088=...armies from the Dominion and Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00089=...with help from Arcturus' son, Valerian...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00090=...and free her from Amon's grasp.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00091=The Dominion wanted her dead. Raynor couldn't allow it.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00092=...and began planning their next move.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00093=...but his father could not let this opportunity pass.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00094=Kerrigan escaped, while Raynor...
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00095=She set out to reclaim her position... as Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00096=...and ruled the Swarm once again... only this time... free.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00097=...one mission at a time.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00098=She learned that Raynor was still alive.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00099=Despite encountering his best troops,  and traps, she personally ended his life.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00100=Amon's plans were still unfolding.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00101=Kerrigan left Raynor to rebuild while she hunted her true enemy.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00102=...with a just government.
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00103=Hierarch Artanis saw an opportunity. 
Conversation/Cutscene_SSF/LOTVLine00104=...templar and dark templar alike... would retake Aiur.
